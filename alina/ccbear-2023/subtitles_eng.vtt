613479886
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.667
Whoo!

3186438798
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.542
Yeah!

3823214412
00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:18.125
Whoo!

610073720
00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:24.500
Mmm, mmm.

1322801565
00:01:27.042 --> 00:01:28.751
Whoo!

4001543199
00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:39.626
Whoo!

1770072808
00:01:39.626 --> 00:01:40.751
Mwah.

807622211
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.334
Whoo!

2226116252
00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:16.626
You know
the first thing I thought

2035373092
00:02:16.626 --> 00:02:18.459
<i>when I saw you?</i>

158773506
00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.959
<i>I thought, "I want to make
a child with that person."</i>

957767666
00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:27.209
<i>What if it's a her?</i>

1508792760
00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.876
<i>What would you call her?</i>

3376646916
00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:32.167
<i>Ragni, maybe.</i>

3135062293
00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:33.834
Sorry?

3863317642
00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:34.667
Ragni.

3095294924
00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:38.375
Uh, let me think about
that for a second.

425744781
00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:40.709
–Ragni.
–You hate it.

3283007642
00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.500
–Uh, boy's name?
–Texas.

2729258691
00:02:43.626 --> 00:02:45.000
You kidding me?

774599569
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.500
–Texas is, like, a state,
you know? –I know.

595749815
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.751
There's about
three or four hours

248116907
00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:52.125
till we reach the peak.

3378834892
00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:53.918
Ah, great.

2360208738
00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.792
Sweetie, can I just say
one last thing?

3732849060
00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:05.417
Then, I swear,
no more wedding talk.

4151631679
00:03:05.417 --> 00:03:07.500
–Of course.
–It's about the band.

2550377464
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.167
But that is the one thing
you said I could handle myself,

383235558
00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:12.709
and I've already made
my decision, Elsa.

1493634949
00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.876
Yeah, it's just that
I don't want

3698133926
00:03:14.876 --> 00:03:16.959
to use your brother's band.

2690393317
00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.250
–Why not?
–Honey...

4251733154
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.584
He's super, super good.

100624869
00:03:19.584 --> 00:03:21.209
–He works super hard.
–Yeah.

1303962224
00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.375
And–and he–he even takes
vocal lessons now.

636901612
00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:24.167
Yeah, I know this.

2758477548
00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:27.083
I know this. It's just that,
um, well, Eric is no good.

1041189199
00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:30.999
I mean, he's, well,
terrible, actually.

2160992818
00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:34.000
His singing is like shit.

1302270281
00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.542
Hey. I mean, he has a nice b...

1432699143
00:03:39.542 --> 00:03:41.500
Olaf!

1096044415
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.876
Olaf, I didn't mean to...
Oh, God.

2468489692
00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:45.083
Wait for me.

2866876157
00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:47.709
Why are you so sensitive?

3849875866
00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.459
Told you I could get us here.

1671520538
00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.667
It's beautiful.

1602275772
00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:05.292
Thank you. I love you.

187475174
00:04:16.042 --> 00:04:17.375
Elsa.

2735073847
00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:21.209
–Look. Look.
–What is it? Hmm? Hmm?

3480098638
00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.500
Look.

1086759700
00:04:25.042 --> 00:04:26.792
Quick, the camera.
Get the camera.

1980409760
00:04:26.792 --> 00:04:29.959
Oh, my, I've always wanted
to see a bear in real life.

2271569285
00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:32.626
First, humpbacks in Iceland,
and now this.

108112492
00:04:32.626 --> 00:04:35.334
We have such good luck
in nature.

1589117351
00:04:44.042 --> 00:04:45.959
What do you see?

3040872353
00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:48.459
Hmm?

1632311612
00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:51.334
It's demented or something.

4126334649
00:04:51.334 --> 00:04:53.125
What?

1683832934
00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:57.500
–Can I get the camera?
Give me the camera. –Yeah.

496906075
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.167
Demented?

3109859167
00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:00.542
I–I–I think we should leave it.

3867509057
00:05:00.542 --> 00:05:02.667
It's–it's something wrong
with it. Come on.

888920150
00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:03.667
– Come on..
– Ah!

2233933916
00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:06.834
– Shh. Come on.
– It's so cute.

2155038470
00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:09.876
Oh, there's nothing
to be afraid of, Kristoffer.

3604853019
00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:12.792
I'm not afraid, Elsa.

2157125605
00:05:12.918 --> 00:05:16.209
Oh, sweetie, now, of course not.

3717562886
00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:20.125
Oh,

804886817
00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:22.999
Don't panic.

2574176283
00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.876
What do we do?

4145748671
00:05:23.876 --> 00:05:25.667
"If it's black, fight back.

2161920121
00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:27.083
If it's brown, lay down."

1966648367
00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:28.959
But is it black or is it brown?

523043711
00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:29.999
I mean, it looks brown to me.

1384215926
00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:31.709
We're in Appalachia.
It's black.

2918167707
00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:33.709
–We have to fight it.
–How do you know?

2783122576
00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:35.792
You're not a bear expert.

980316355
00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:37.709
Whatever you do, don't...

555010821
00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:39.792
–Run! Where are we going?
–Oh–oh, no. Oh–oh, no.

656728595
00:05:39.792 --> 00:05:41.500
–I said don't run! Stop! Stop!
–Uphill. Uphill.

3775507135
00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:45.083
– Run!
– Where do we go?

1667650036
00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:47.417
–Run, Elsa! Run!
–Where do we go?

1353771924
00:05:47.417 --> 00:05:49.626
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

2926647064
00:05:49.626 --> 00:05:51.709
Run!

3445256399
00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:53.334
He's coming! Come on!

2313144402
00:05:53.334 --> 00:05:55.334
No! It's following...

3170982784
00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:02.334
Olaf! No!

4202167913
00:06:02.334 --> 00:06:03.459
God!

121123348
00:06:12.751 --> 00:06:14.500
– Help me!
– Come on! Come on!

3039798809
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.500
Olaf!

2633772315
00:06:40.417 --> 00:06:42.459
This is drugs.

4062620479
00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:45.000
This is your brain on drugs.

3201049587
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.999
It isn't glamorous
or cool or kid stuff.

1344871881
00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:51.417
The thrill can kill.

3510243373
00:06:51.417 --> 00:06:57.459
Smoking crack is like
putting a gun in your mouth...

3237358186
00:06:58.667 --> 00:07:01.542
...and pulling the trigger.

366257763
00:07:02.918 --> 00:07:06.083
Millions of dollars' worth of
cocaine dropped from the sky

2181314120
00:07:06.083 --> 00:07:09.292
early today onto a driveway
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

890023706
00:07:09.292 --> 00:07:11.167
Kenley Jones reports tonight
it was found

1382663174
00:07:11.167 --> 00:07:13.584
on the body of a man
who fell to his death

3076229623
00:07:13.584 --> 00:07:16.000
when his parachute
failed to open.

1441830474
00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:19.959
The body of the heavily
armed parachutist was found

884631272
00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:22.959
early this morning
by 85–year–old Fred Myers

1318141650
00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:24.250
and his neighbor, Ralph Johnson.

4080813886
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.292
And you could see that
his main chute didn't open,

151324030
00:07:26.292 --> 00:07:28.167
so I guess the loafers
was too much for him.

2012060346
00:07:28.167 --> 00:07:31.250
Police found more than
70 pounds of cocaine

2799644296
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.083
wrapped in
football–size packages

3273068589
00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:37.000
in a duffel bag
the chutist was carrying.

4277684875
00:07:40.876 --> 00:07:45.792
Emergency chute deployed,
but didn't help much, I suppose.

389621874
00:07:45.792 --> 00:07:48.709
Any narcotics found
with the plane wreckage?

55421316
00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:49.959
Nothing.

1764539117
00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:51.959
Here's the I.D.

1719002519
00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:53.459
I know who that is.

415436452
00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:57.083
Full name:
Andrew C. Thornton II.

349219849
00:07:57.083 --> 00:07:59.834
Man was out of his mind.

1700330533
00:08:01.292 --> 00:08:03.250
–What's the "C" stand for?
–Hmm?

2015751013
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.709
You said "full name," but
you didn't say his full name.

2117908219
00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:12.209
Thornton was one of Syd
White's guys out of Missouri.

3716541099
00:08:12.209 --> 00:08:15.542
He's a known drug trafficker
with ties to Colombia.

1559677010
00:08:15.542 --> 00:08:18.334
Part of
the Bluegrass Conspiracy.

941703118
00:08:18.334 --> 00:08:22.417
And there's more of this
out there.

3489811539
00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:25.167
They dumped it somewhere.

540261085
00:08:26.626 --> 00:08:28.834
Hey, Reba,
you have a dog, right?

3629596922
00:08:28.834 --> 00:08:30.125
Had.

1768447670
00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:32.959
Border collie. Barry.

1455295575
00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:35.083
Sorry for your loss.

4088299854
00:08:35.083 --> 00:08:37.042
Border collie, huh?

776387023
00:08:37.042 --> 00:08:38.918
That's a cool dog.

2788066538
00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:40.500
Did he play fetch and stuff?

3849219163
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.292
He loved fetch.

3110498195
00:08:43.626 --> 00:08:44.834
What?

107352314
00:08:44.834 --> 00:08:46.626
Nothing. I just...

2603153749
00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:50.125
That's just awesome.

526696194
00:09:07.834 --> 00:09:09.292
Screw it, Gabe.

3363018831
00:09:09.292 --> 00:09:10.709
Hi, Daveed.

3771818903
00:09:12.417 --> 00:09:15.167
Uh, mind if I order first?

2100540449
00:09:15.167 --> 00:09:17.918
This won't take long.

2057669313
00:09:22.417 --> 00:09:25.876
I just bought these.

366604462
00:09:30.167 --> 00:09:32.834
Hey, how's Gabe doing, anyway?

1871974056
00:09:32.834 --> 00:09:35.834
Did you hear about Thornton?

2240533173
00:09:35.959 --> 00:09:36.999
It's a tough way to go.

3272231665
00:09:36.999 --> 00:09:38.834
He only had 30 kilos on him.

2162373254
00:09:38.834 --> 00:09:41.667
Any idea where
we could find the rest?

1001327462
00:09:41.999 --> 00:09:43.751
Chattahoochee.

972951760
00:09:43.751 --> 00:09:44.250
Georgia?

2179009476
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.292
There's an area
called Blood Mountain.

3621016895
00:09:46.292 --> 00:09:47.667
When the plane's going down,

2731129376
00:09:47.667 --> 00:09:49.918
the pilots know
where to drop our load.

3318055552
00:09:49.918 --> 00:09:51.209
And then we just go and get it.

3042998074
00:09:51.209 --> 00:09:54.375
I don't need a bunch
of worried Colombians.

1990290686
00:09:54.375 --> 00:09:56.709
Now, I want you
to take Eddie with you.

2395224975
00:09:56.709 --> 00:09:58.209
Eddie's in mourning.

2324923174
00:09:58.209 --> 00:09:59.999
Joanie just died.

3892092062
00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:00.959
And he quit.

2995254918
00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:02.876
Joanie's the reason why he quit.

588297152
00:10:02.876 --> 00:10:04.042
She's not here anymore.

95238138
00:10:04.042 --> 00:10:06.626
The sooner he moves on,
the better.

4095432010
00:10:06.626 --> 00:10:08.918
Syd, I–I just don't...

3799506547
00:10:08.918 --> 00:10:09.459
Stop.

813156349
00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:12.167
He won't even come
to get his son.

299576576
00:10:12.167 --> 00:10:15.876
I am sick and tired
of watching my kid's kid.

3333787738
00:10:15.876 --> 00:10:18.751
Grandpa Syd, watch.

3839478448
00:10:19.292 --> 00:10:21.999
Yeah, that's great.

1517840756
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.459
Got to go. Shift starts at 8:00.

1053855339
00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.999
Tomorrow's lunch is in
the fridge, and the chicken's...

3097992901
00:10:31.167 --> 00:10:32.918
Chicken's in the microwave.

1455969442
00:10:32.918 --> 00:10:35.250
Just hit "start."

2713550394
00:10:35.334 --> 00:10:37.292
Thought you were off tonight.

3401337346
00:10:37.292 --> 00:10:38.999
We talked about this, remember?

2712633984
00:10:38.999 --> 00:10:40.459
Me picking up some extra shifts?

2952773530
00:10:40.459 --> 00:10:41.792
You said you were okay with it.

299123526
00:10:41.792 --> 00:10:43.334
I was okay with it
until I realized

1213013429
00:10:43.334 --> 00:10:44.999
why you want
those extra shifts––

3847541559
00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:50.292
so you could go and do overtime
with Ray the Pediatrician.

969833472
00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:54.125
Gross, Dee Dee. Gross.

1031552190
00:10:54.209 --> 00:10:56.834
You know, he invited us
to go to Nashville

4088997735
00:10:56.834 --> 00:10:58.083
this weekend
to see his band play.

4162723021
00:10:58.083 --> 00:11:01.417
We were supposed to go paint
the waterfall this weekend.

67586827
00:11:01.417 --> 00:11:02.834
I know, but it's gonna be fun.

96467806
00:11:02.834 --> 00:11:04.876
We're gonna make
a whole weekend out of it.

2602027133
00:11:04.876 --> 00:11:06.542
It's Nashville.

3670753732
00:11:06.542 --> 00:11:09.834
He's a good guy, Deirdra.

914267498
00:11:10.417 --> 00:11:11.334
Just...

3276880088
00:11:11.334 --> 00:11:12.918
Give him a chance.

3477868667
00:11:12.918 --> 00:11:15.125
Please don't do that.

1927727365
00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:16.918
Do what?

1872564113
00:11:17.918 --> 00:11:19.334
You know what.

2265499759
00:11:19.334 --> 00:11:23.375
We'll paint the waterfall
another weekend, okay?

1008590390
00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:27.918
Close my door.

1990988460
00:11:33.999 --> 00:11:36.584
That's enough for today.

3612711983
00:11:36.584 --> 00:11:39.125
Wait, what?

2683302203
00:11:39.667 --> 00:11:41.792
Hey, Eddie.

1552330291
00:11:41.792 --> 00:11:46.042
They spelled her name wrong,
Daveed.

4180251028
00:11:46.792 --> 00:11:48.584
–It says "John."
–Oh.

3544161470
00:11:48.584 --> 00:11:50.500
–Says "John."
–Yeah.

3828888866
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.834
–Her name is Joan.
–Look, we...

2564702630
00:11:52.834 --> 00:11:54.667
–We could get it fixed.
–No.

1379449710
00:11:54.667 --> 00:11:57.000
I got to wait a week
for it to heal first.

3396554037
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.667
I got seven more days of "John."

3408290122
00:11:58.667 --> 00:12:00.709
The chutist has been identified

2201782715
00:12:00.709 --> 00:12:02.667
as Andrew Thornton
of Paris, Kentucky.

1782450388
00:12:02.667 --> 00:12:04.584
–Wait, is that us?
–Hey.

3991033790
00:12:04.584 --> 00:12:08.417
Listen, Syd is worried
about you, all right?

892939812
00:12:08.417 --> 00:12:11.542
Says you haven't seen Gabe
in weeks.

1544430645
00:12:13.292 --> 00:12:15.542
I'm so sad, man.

2309884357
00:12:15.542 --> 00:12:18.334
I'm so sad.

2410304674
00:12:18.334 --> 00:12:20.500
Okay?

538360573
00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:28.999
Can I get the, uh...
the penne, please?

3992500286
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:32.000
Does it come with chicken,
or is it just, uh...

3378362315
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
It's just plain.

2380456519
00:12:44.918 --> 00:12:46.083
I knew you'd be late.

1715156935
00:12:46.083 --> 00:12:48.375
It finally came in.
Check it out.

611889862
00:12:48.375 --> 00:12:50.250
How many weeks' allowance
is that?

3831726527
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.167
Like a thousand, but worth it.

315924426
00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:53.999
–Can I use the toilet?
–Uh, no.

3970838907
00:12:53.999 --> 00:12:55.459
My mom is gonna be home soon.

3648602869
00:12:55.459 --> 00:13:00.292
And we got to go if we want
to get to the falls by lunch.

2859351399
00:13:00.292 --> 00:13:02.125
Why by lunch?

3549200816
00:13:02.125 --> 00:13:04.292
The light, Henry.

490186631
00:13:04.709 --> 00:13:06.792
But I got to go pee.

986374615
00:13:06.792 --> 00:13:07.876
Go outside.

3926332573
00:13:07.876 --> 00:13:09.459
Why do I skip school with you?

3405896473
00:13:09.459 --> 00:13:12.042
You're bossier than
the teachers.

2463055022
00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:13.292
Now, the adoption people––

3210666739
00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:15.334
I'm not sure who I talked to
over there––

1317396019
00:13:15.334 --> 00:13:17.584
told me I was supposed to be
getting me a Lab.

2695290015
00:13:17.584 --> 00:13:21.250
A fun one, a...
a man's–best–friend type.

28061533
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:22.792
I don't know
if there was an error,

1414847244
00:13:22.792 --> 00:13:25.709
because the one I got
is just kind of...

2195775480
00:13:25.709 --> 00:13:27.709
– Bob?
– ...I don't know,

52322832
00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:28.709
just kind of fancy.

180938888
00:13:28.709 --> 00:13:31.167
–Bob, Captain says
it's time to go. –Got it.

1067049355
00:13:31.167 --> 00:13:34.209
Hey, look, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

662833768
00:13:35.626 --> 00:13:36.876
Hey, Reba.

4159080957
00:13:36.876 --> 00:13:39.709
You got plans for tonight?

3309741113
00:13:39.792 --> 00:13:41.999
Uh, Bob, you're a nice guy.

1952718073
00:13:41.999 --> 00:13:45.375
–I just don't...
–Mind looking after Rosette?

997319971
00:13:46.334 --> 00:13:47.959
–Oh.
–I have to go to Georgia

3348959623
00:13:47.959 --> 00:13:48.834
for the Thornton case,

3482147384
00:13:48.834 --> 00:13:50.834
and you said
you were good at dogs.

28257527
00:13:50.834 --> 00:13:52.167
I said I had a dog.

1904166107
00:13:52.167 --> 00:13:54.959
You don't have jurisdiction
in Georgia.

1691383299
00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:56.751
A trucker overheard
a couple of guys

415825564
00:13:56.751 --> 00:13:57.959
talking at a bar last night.

1939080310
00:13:57.959 --> 00:14:00.918
–I'll tell you in the car.
–No, no, no.

2120184635
00:14:00.918 --> 00:14:02.000
Pretty sure they're Syd's guys.

1844649087
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.584
Oh, come on. You got to be
sort of good with them.

3376017152
00:14:05.584 --> 00:14:07.876
I only had her for a day.

158952066
00:14:07.876 --> 00:14:08.459
Please?

361120043
00:14:08.459 --> 00:14:12.334
Uh, I don't know if I could
trust anyone else around here.

1089039235
00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:15.292
Just go.

2554611163
00:14:15.292 --> 00:14:17.500
We'll be fine.

3335843128
00:14:17.959 --> 00:14:19.334
Thanks.

1052389594
00:14:20.751 --> 00:14:22.876
Can't believe
I left the backpack.

4017029776
00:14:22.876 --> 00:14:24.417
I can. I know the way.

793345238
00:14:24.417 --> 00:14:26.542
School's gonna call, you know.

752452431
00:14:26.542 --> 00:14:28.292
You know what? Let 'em.

154651022
00:14:28.292 --> 00:14:30.918
And your mom's gonna be pissed.

995422579
00:14:30.918 --> 00:14:32.167
So's your dad.

1317965474
00:14:32.167 --> 00:14:33.584
He doesn't care if I play hooky.

2130348899
00:14:33.584 --> 00:14:35.292
For a girl who likes
to be left alone,

1205198747
00:14:35.292 --> 00:14:36.626
you do a lot of shit
for attention.

1430963087
00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:38.375
Look, I'm not
ditching for attention.

4171171400
00:14:38.375 --> 00:14:40.167
I just want to paint
the waterfall.

1112513137
00:14:40.167 --> 00:14:41.000
Admit it.

781770443
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.417
You want her to find out
and worry about you.

740125941
00:15:12.125 --> 00:15:15.125
Jesus!

2288200120
00:15:15.417 --> 00:15:16.709
Coral, it's Sari.

2066742084
00:15:16.709 --> 00:15:18.167
Is Dee Dee over there?

799263588
00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:20.375
School just called.

3364583560
00:15:20.375 --> 00:15:20.999
No.

496803353
00:15:20.999 --> 00:15:24.125
Yeah, well, can you just
put Elliot on?

1832248140
00:15:24.125 --> 00:15:26.250
Yes, well, his daughter
just ditched school,

2521281011
00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.751
so can you please
just put him on?

529238595
00:15:30.459 --> 00:15:32.959
Every time I call,
he's in the bathroom.

3922679943
00:15:32.959 --> 00:15:35.959
What the hell is wrong with him?

4155564691
00:15:36.209 --> 00:15:38.626
Never mind.

1880887397
00:16:19.999 --> 00:16:22.209
50 cents.

2280613345
00:16:27.459 --> 00:16:29.584
I'm not gonna see
that wrapper outside

3763946559
00:16:29.584 --> 00:16:31.292
–on the ground, now, am I?
–No, ma'am.

3087736416
00:16:31.292 --> 00:16:33.959
You one of those kids
caused me a bunch of shit?

4264248721
00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:36.250
–What?
–Empty your pockets.

665226720
00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.209
Vest pocket. Come on.

3905648904
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:43.417
Is that perfume?

3666298471
00:16:43.417 --> 00:16:45.167
That's none of your business.

2032988866
00:16:45.167 --> 00:16:47.584
Well, it smells really nice.

2686080280
00:16:47.584 --> 00:16:50.334
Yeah, well, it's European.

1897982697
00:16:50.334 --> 00:16:50.876
Oh.

1187838359
00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:52.876
Yeah, I'm expecting someone
in a minute.

2364398337
00:16:52.876 --> 00:16:54.751
Is it too much?

1356626268
00:16:54.751 --> 00:16:55.792
Not at all.

3617434517
00:16:55.792 --> 00:16:56.751
Smells expensive.

4045097843
00:16:56.751 --> 00:17:00.375
Well, it is.

3318933643
00:17:00.375 --> 00:17:02.375
You want a sucker?

3761850036
00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:04.042
Sure.

2250155779
00:17:04.042 --> 00:17:05.209
I like the green one.

144731238
00:17:05.209 --> 00:17:06.834
This is a red one.

1787060713
00:17:06.834 --> 00:17:10.000
–Yes, ma'am.
–Uh–huh.

964805687
00:17:10.667 --> 00:17:13.626
Oh, shit. He's here.

3419947960
00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:24.542
Am I in the right place?

3950038270
00:17:26.792 --> 00:17:28.999
Oh! Right.

983735793
00:17:28.999 --> 00:17:30.250
Told you it was big.

3189173623
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.792
Oh, it's big.

4211163512
00:17:32.918 --> 00:17:34.167
What's that smell?

3650979899
00:17:34.167 --> 00:17:35.751
It's European.

3013164427
00:17:37.792 --> 00:17:39.918
Someone been smoking?

3326564674
00:17:39.918 --> 00:17:41.125
Um, he was.

4061509177
00:17:41.125 --> 00:17:42.250
–Can you believe it?
–What?

976647727
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.626
You know,
cigarettes kill people.

3623033692
00:17:43.626 --> 00:17:44.876
–Yeah, but...
–And animals.

912933920
00:17:44.876 --> 00:17:48.250
Forest fires are the number one
cause of death for wildlife.

2298559886
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.167
Yeah, and y–you should be
educating yourself

4147580668
00:17:50.167 --> 00:17:52.542
instead of endangering
the entire ecosystem.

4193022714
00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:54.417
Just get out of here.

3506008825
00:17:54.417 --> 00:17:57.083
Get out.

901790982
00:17:57.083 --> 00:17:59.167
Unbelievable.

446177594
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.083
You got a dusty beaver here,
Ranger.

951968839
00:18:02.083 --> 00:18:04.459
Yeah, well, I'm working on that.

3242567291
00:18:25.959 --> 00:18:27.626
Hey, Henry!

145311802
00:18:27.626 --> 00:18:31.083
It looks like the deer
on this sign are doing it!

3146783193
00:18:31.083 --> 00:18:33.125
Hold on.

181793877
00:18:33.584 --> 00:18:37.250
Seriously, what the hell
are you even doing?

3763149543
00:18:37.459 --> 00:18:38.918
Marking our territory.

798541806
00:18:38.918 --> 00:18:40.667
Ugh! Don't shit out here!

1643803143
00:18:40.667 --> 00:18:44.876
I'm not shitting.

1066877679
00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:49.334
Hey. Did your mom pack
double lunch for school again?

1881580318
00:18:49.334 --> 00:18:52.167
My dad didn't have a chance
to make any.

1369593033
00:18:52.167 --> 00:18:54.459
Hey, Henry.

4259193039
00:19:03.459 --> 00:19:05.834
Check it out.

817549896
00:19:08.375 --> 00:19:10.083
It's drugs, I think.

3962552819
00:19:10.083 --> 00:19:11.500
It's drugs?

3353933261
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.876
Remember that guy from assembly?

4104554392
00:19:12.876 --> 00:19:16.292
He showed us pictures of stuff
that looked just like this.

1189375101
00:19:16.292 --> 00:19:18.751
Yeah. The guy from Vietnam
with no legs.

1663940393
00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:19.918
No.

1315797170
00:19:19.918 --> 00:19:22.250
This is definitely cocaine.

2297656632
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.167
Yeah. Of course.

1671927538
00:19:23.167 --> 00:19:25.876
I'm just not used to
seeing it like that.

4221920212
00:19:25.876 --> 00:19:30.918
You know, it's usually
more powdery on the streets.

426270741
00:19:30.918 --> 00:19:33.584
When have you seen cocaine
on the streets?

3230289274
00:19:33.584 --> 00:19:34.918
When I do it.

108079028
00:19:34.918 --> 00:19:35.959
Oh, yeah?

138447949
00:19:35.959 --> 00:19:36.918
With who?

4276703727
00:19:36.918 --> 00:19:38.334
With Faulk.

2333217075
00:19:38.334 --> 00:19:39.125
After church.

2451714329
00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:41.334
Faulk does not do cocaine
after church.

979467839
00:19:41.334 --> 00:19:42.999
Are you friends with Faulk?

2434609407
00:19:42.999 --> 00:19:44.042
No. He's a pervert.

4005133095
00:19:44.042 --> 00:19:45.667
Then you wouldn't know.

3244860951
00:19:45.667 --> 00:19:46.209
Liar.

4013740572
00:19:46.209 --> 00:19:48.709
You're just mad
you're never invited.

1848017359
00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:50.834
I don't care I'm not invited.

1111334545
00:19:50.834 --> 00:19:53.584
Sounds like you care.

2853303212
00:19:53.834 --> 00:19:56.542
How much do you think
this stuff is worth?

1673368903
00:19:56.542 --> 00:19:57.709
Let's sell drugs together.

2085779731
00:19:57.709 --> 00:20:01.751
Yeah, we could sell them on
the street like you and Faulk.

2038957604
00:20:01.751 --> 00:20:04.876
There's more.

2512199106
00:20:06.626 --> 00:20:07.959
Ow.

2272464810
00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:12.042
Something got into it.

2116048078
00:20:12.042 --> 00:20:13.000
A deer, maybe.

2616523004
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.667
Could you imagine that?
Deer on cocaine?

804917202
00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:16.459
It'd be like this.

459611561
00:20:16.459 --> 00:20:19.375
Yeah, it'd be, like,
going into trees like–– bang!

2486437947
00:20:19.375 --> 00:20:21.292
–Bang!
–Yep, and then it'd get stuck.

2588556166
00:20:21.292 --> 00:20:23.083
Yeah, and then it'd be so sad.

63837311
00:20:23.083 --> 00:20:26.292
Hey, Dee Dee. Do you think
my dad has ever done cocaine?

229606441
00:20:26.292 --> 00:20:29.709
Your dad has definitely
done cocaine.

2057270308
00:20:31.709 --> 00:20:33.999
My throat's really runny.

2266052658
00:20:36.959 --> 00:20:39.500
Stop that.

1375644005
00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:53.083
Did it do the cocaine?

43584756
00:20:53.083 --> 00:20:56.042
Don't move a muscle.

616345651
00:21:01.459 --> 00:21:02.667
Listen to me.

1872224954
00:21:02.667 --> 00:21:05.751
You were supposed to grab Eddie,
not run your mouth.

1802434514
00:21:05.751 --> 00:21:07.667
–Now we have trouble.
You understand? –Got it.

1582599031
00:21:07.667 --> 00:21:10.125
I'll take care of it.

3493412808
00:21:10.125 --> 00:21:11.918
Gabe, knock that off. Gabe.

242203801
00:21:11.918 --> 00:21:14.999
– Grandpa Syd!
– Gabe, driving me nuts.

2904023392
00:21:14.999 --> 00:21:16.334
Little...

3480711772
00:21:44.918 --> 00:21:47.083
Joan loved this song.

3333693054
00:21:47.751 --> 00:21:52.584
She said he sang with the soul
of a thousand–year–old man.

3463514926
00:21:55.959 --> 00:21:57.792
Um, Eddie, listen.

959953431
00:21:57.792 --> 00:22:01.751
Uh, when Joanie died,

3582267183
00:22:01.751 --> 00:22:05.083
I'm sorry I didn't, you know...

1270764588
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.167
It's fine.

2125803675
00:22:07.167 --> 00:22:09.042
No, I could've did more.

2618750719
00:22:09.042 --> 00:22:09.918
It's fine.

935268292
00:22:09.918 --> 00:22:11.000
I should've been there.

2061787536
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:11.876
I didn't need you there.

2943660385
00:22:11.876 --> 00:22:13.542
I don't hang out
with drug dealers anymore.

2725320073
00:22:13.542 --> 00:22:15.000
It's against my constitution.

3509648699
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.792
I'm more than a drug dealer.

2085629362
00:22:16.792 --> 00:22:19.250
–No, you're not.
–Come on, Eddie.

982839597
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.918
We're friends, right?

2155368497
00:22:20.918 --> 00:22:21.918
No.

521725387
00:22:21.918 --> 00:22:24.167
Fine.

896658448
00:22:24.459 --> 00:22:26.709
I think he's happy she's dead.

102478837
00:22:26.709 --> 00:22:27.667
He's not happy she died.

3518191407
00:22:27.667 --> 00:22:30.417
Blamed her for me leaving
the family business,

1001491393
00:22:30.417 --> 00:22:33.334
if we can call it that.

1596022119
00:22:33.334 --> 00:22:34.626
Sometimes...

2082323893
00:22:34.626 --> 00:22:37.125
–I wonder if he did it to her.
–What?

2863464115
00:22:37.125 --> 00:22:39.083
No, Joanie died of cancer.

2408883022
00:22:39.083 --> 00:22:39.918
I know.

2265450407
00:22:39.918 --> 00:22:41.959
Maybe he gave her the cancer.

1597161395
00:22:41.959 --> 00:22:43.417
You can't give no one cancer.

1732828015
00:22:43.417 --> 00:22:45.125
Yes, you can. With stress.

202309076
00:22:45.125 --> 00:22:46.500
Stop protecting him.

382008369
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.209
You know what?
Maybe I should turn this off.

1864743201
00:22:49.209 --> 00:22:49.834
No!

47502355
00:22:59.042 --> 00:23:00.000
Okay.

1804634467
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.959
Okay, so we start...

1944144259
00:23:05.959 --> 00:23:07.709
–Did you notice my nails?
–Those are beautiful.

2962438425
00:23:07.709 --> 00:23:11.584
–Thank you. We start...
–Excuse me. Is the ranger in?

149598348
00:23:11.584 --> 00:23:13.292
I'm wearing the stuff.

3296774571
00:23:13.292 --> 00:23:15.999
Oh. Did either of you
see a girl,

3490266046
00:23:15.999 --> 00:23:17.751
13, come through here?
My daughter...

3200303445
00:23:17.751 --> 00:23:19.292
You lost your daughter
in the park.

2428861378
00:23:19.292 --> 00:23:21.876
Well, she came here on her own,
heading to the waterfall.

1278381549
00:23:21.876 --> 00:23:24.959
Yeah. Hikers under 16 must be
accompanied by an adult.

3723728265
00:23:24.959 --> 00:23:26.918
Well, I didn't know
she was coming here.

362350435
00:23:26.918 --> 00:23:28.334
You know, we get
a lot of runaways,

874825229
00:23:28.334 --> 00:23:30.999
bad apples,
youngsters who aren't too happy

1833455151
00:23:30.999 --> 00:23:32.542
with the way things are at home.

1494144116
00:23:32.542 --> 00:23:33.709
She's not a runaway.

2853368119
00:23:33.709 --> 00:23:35.167
She just came to paint the...

3999414052
00:23:35.167 --> 00:23:36.292
Can someone just please point me

4035161618
00:23:36.292 --> 00:23:37.918
in the direction
of Blood Mountain?

327062649
00:23:37.918 --> 00:23:39.667
This is Blood Mountain.

4213783739
00:23:39.667 --> 00:23:40.959
– Sorry. I–I'm Peter.
– Oh.

3757437647
00:23:40.959 --> 00:23:42.292
This is Peter,
wildlife inspection rep.

1067036998
00:23:42.292 --> 00:23:45.292
We're about to head up there
ourselves.

2786949636
00:23:45.292 --> 00:23:46.500
Oh. Do you mind if I tag along?

2820333254
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.167
Now, Peter,
the wildlife inspection

2692345279
00:23:48.167 --> 00:23:49.542
is a very important process.

3421929447
00:23:49.542 --> 00:23:50.709
We wouldn't want you distracted

1158808938
00:23:50.709 --> 00:23:52.626
by our little
damsel in distress here.

3098867790
00:23:52.626 --> 00:23:53.999
Nothing can distract me

3911172284
00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:56.876
from making sure
the entire biological community

1714605383
00:23:56.876 --> 00:23:59.000
is safe for all our friends.

1723244623
00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.918
Friends?

551569820
00:23:59.918 --> 00:24:01.834
–He means animals.
–I don't like that word.

823539699
00:24:01.834 --> 00:24:04.417
He doesn't like
to call them animals.

2245279403
00:24:04.417 --> 00:24:07.417
Well, I won't be a burden.

3914601791
00:24:08.709 --> 00:24:10.959
I'll get my hat.

3555400008
00:24:11.375 --> 00:24:13.459
Okay.

511203984
00:24:16.584 --> 00:24:18.000
Shoes okay for hiking?

2469200108
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.042
Oh, yeah.
I–I think I'll be okay.

435549569
00:24:20.042 --> 00:24:21.959
– I have on boots.
– Yep.

2657621152
00:24:21.959 --> 00:24:23.500
Come on, Eddie.

3178121734
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.083
I'm done playing this game.

3782763990
00:24:25.083 --> 00:24:26.083
You–you wanted...

2148981397
00:24:26.083 --> 00:24:27.709
You were the one
who wanted to play this.

138572311
00:24:27.709 --> 00:24:29.751
You still have
three more questions.

3143735837
00:24:29.751 --> 00:24:32.667
– Listen.
– What?

2771527865
00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:34.626
I'm tired of playing
this   game.

1302259381
00:24:34.626 --> 00:24:36.417
No, you're not.
You just don't want to lose.

2335237852
00:24:36.417 --> 00:24:40.083
I'm–a go in here
and take a piss, all right?

2044056685
00:24:43.709 --> 00:24:46.667
I didn't know
rangers carried guns.

3122180274
00:24:46.667 --> 00:24:49.042
Park rangers are peace officers.

3642013682
00:24:49.042 --> 00:24:51.083
Which means we can shoot people.

1621414444
00:24:51.083 --> 00:24:53.334
Forest is a dangerous place.

196620046
00:24:53.334 --> 00:24:55.918
That gang of pubes
are dangerous.

2924603205
00:24:55.918 --> 00:24:57.125
"Gang of pubes"?

2651384848
00:24:57.125 --> 00:24:58.542
Teens. Delinquents.

1552223671
00:25:00.417 --> 00:25:02.918
They've been attacking hikers.

2516153076
00:25:02.918 --> 00:25:04.209
They hurt anyone?

1657553089
00:25:04.209 --> 00:25:07.083
They cut them with a knife.

2706308664
00:25:07.334 --> 00:25:09.876
Call themselves the Doochamps.

972395230
00:25:09.876 --> 00:25:12.083
Watch your back.

390621246
00:25:12.083 --> 00:25:14.834
Pop–art punks
pop up out of nowhere.

1344594637
00:25:14.834 --> 00:25:17.999
Out of nowhere.

232239934
00:25:29.792 --> 00:25:32.209
What is this?

3782164646
00:25:32.999 --> 00:25:35.459
He's afraid, buds.

33884630
00:25:35.459 --> 00:25:37.209
Empty your pockets.

2462159192
00:25:37.209 --> 00:25:38.417
No.

174253825
00:25:38.417 --> 00:25:41.125
Empty your pockets, please.

398059708
00:25:42.626 --> 00:25:44.250
Since you asked so nicely.

277736524
00:25:44.834 --> 00:25:47.709
You think this is a joke?

1062664939
00:25:47.709 --> 00:25:48.999
I do.

3226027231
00:25:48.999 --> 00:25:50.042
Get him, buds.

3074722374
00:25:50.042 --> 00:25:51.709
I'm shaking
a knife, man. Come on.

1575239846
00:25:51.709 --> 00:25:54.042
–Just stab him. –Come on, man.
It's a knife!

3199573559
00:25:54.042 --> 00:25:55.584
Go on!

1171727370
00:25:58.667 --> 00:26:00.083
Oh!

2668676000
00:26:00.083 --> 00:26:01.459
Come on, Rocky. Come on, Rocky.

2830240900
00:26:01.459 --> 00:26:03.292
–Come on, Rocky.
–Ah! Banzai!

1022767997
00:26:04.834 --> 00:26:07.918
Give me this board!

2577446349
00:26:08.417 --> 00:26:10.959
You're going down, man!

3547490831
00:26:17.292 --> 00:26:19.167
Submit! Submit!

3702297890
00:26:19.167 --> 00:26:20.999
What the...

868296038
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.667
Hold this!

1120190492
00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:28.584
Aah! Skateboard!

3152141511
00:26:39.751 --> 00:26:41.417
Oh, my.

3198726096
00:26:54.417 --> 00:26:56.876
What is wrong with y'all?!!

2089085900
00:26:58.876 --> 00:27:00.250
I love this road.

2728825887
00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:01.459
Ah, love it up there.

1673835988
00:27:01.459 --> 00:27:04.125
So, wait, where is it
that you wanted to go again?

984781362
00:27:04.125 --> 00:27:04.834
What? The falls.

3328260179
00:27:04.834 --> 00:27:06.459
The Secret Falls. Right, well,
we can go up this way

2265301164
00:27:06.459 --> 00:27:08.083
– or take the loop.
– I love the loop.

1536283426
00:27:08.083 --> 00:27:09.999
Well, you can see
the top of the...

2383755967
00:27:09.999 --> 00:27:11.751
This is a more direct...

3456201554
00:27:11.751 --> 00:27:13.834
All right. We're going this way.

705788788
00:27:13.834 --> 00:27:14.834
Well, crap.

2319905878
00:27:14.834 --> 00:27:17.626
Told you she shouldn't
have come with us.

505092192
00:27:17.626 --> 00:27:19.667
Just distracting you completely.

760986241
00:27:19.667 --> 00:27:20.792
She can hear you.

2119946925
00:27:20.792 --> 00:27:24.209
I wanted to get up
to see the sunset.

837252297
00:27:24.626 --> 00:27:27.125
What's taking you so long?

3142196069
00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:29.584
What'd you do?

1444454792
00:27:38.083 --> 00:27:39.999
Please tell me
you found them like this.

382245749
00:27:40.209 --> 00:27:41.250
They attacked me.

3850606230
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.250
Are they dead?

1857288333
00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:43.083
Well, one might be.

80064756
00:27:43.083 --> 00:27:46.459
The–the one that stabbed me
might be dead.

2543219854
00:27:47.792 --> 00:27:50.500
Jesus Chr... They're kids.

1346107452
00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.959
I loved this jersey,
man.

1935619812
00:27:52.959 --> 00:27:54.667
Okay, they're fine.

2366294412
00:27:54.667 --> 00:27:56.626
Thank God.

1054713288
00:27:56.626 --> 00:27:58.709
No  ay.

4194791390
00:28:00.167 --> 00:28:01.459
Daveed?

4002393618
00:28:08.542 --> 00:28:10.000
What happened?

926429248
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.751
Hey.

659114070
00:28:10.751 --> 00:28:11.999
Wake up.

276870702
00:28:11.999 --> 00:28:13.626
Where'd you find this?

2814097526
00:28:13.626 --> 00:28:14.417
Whoa.

1815275775
00:28:14.417 --> 00:28:17.083
Where is this energy
coming from, bud?

3202505763
00:28:17.083 --> 00:28:18.751
You tried to  ill me.

1328397976
00:28:18.751 --> 00:28:20.959
You got a foul mouth there, bud.

3829491465
00:28:20.959 --> 00:28:23.250
I tell him that all the time.

1270582684
00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.083
Where did you find this?

3834621704
00:28:25.083 --> 00:28:26.667
Up on the mountain.

2630748262
00:28:26.667 --> 00:28:27.918
Where's the rest of it?

2612655656
00:28:27.918 --> 00:28:28.959
I don't know.

740656465
00:28:28.959 --> 00:28:32.834
Listen, I just took out
the three of you in 15 seconds.

991173158
00:28:32.834 --> 00:28:34.209
What do you think I'll do
to just you

3048705451
00:28:34.209 --> 00:28:36.999
when you're already
on the floor?

2491447316
00:28:36.999 --> 00:28:38.584
Okay. Okay.

2081961112
00:28:38.584 --> 00:28:41.167
We stashed it under a gazebo.

2370908103
00:28:41.167 --> 00:28:43.417
Going back for it later tonight.

3658048975
00:28:43.417 --> 00:28:44.792
A gazebo?

3198775622
00:28:44.792 --> 00:28:47.667
It's a pavilion–type structure.

3767067757
00:28:47.667 --> 00:28:49.999
I know what
a gazebo is.

1446969238
00:28:49.999 --> 00:28:51.709
I didn't.

4225276529
00:28:52.584 --> 00:28:54.209
Are my buds dead?

3215654947
00:28:54.209 --> 00:28:55.459
–Show us where.
–Oh, God.

595547043
00:28:55.459 --> 00:28:57.999
You know,
I–I'm feeling kind of tired.

2529026160
00:28:57.999 --> 00:28:59.334
I think I should rest.

3831249490
00:28:59.334 --> 00:29:01.250
Okay. Want a dirt nap?

678361874
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:02.792
Eddie, go get the gun.

273046509
00:29:02.792 --> 00:29:03.792
It's in the glove.

2157003314
00:29:03.792 --> 00:29:05.500
I prefer we left guns
out of this.

913172205
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.709
Yeah. Same.

2334533603
00:29:06.709 --> 00:29:09.751
And I would prefer
not to be stabbed.

2026517322
00:29:09.751 --> 00:29:13.125
So, Eddie, please go get
the gun.

2886572322
00:29:13.125 --> 00:29:15.250
Okay.

1527837614
00:29:15.834 --> 00:29:16.999
Okay.

1824364622
00:29:16.999 --> 00:29:18.125
All right, all right.

4177599902
00:29:18.125 --> 00:29:20.584
All right, I'm coming.

2134837763
00:29:21.042 --> 00:29:22.626
Relax.

3265203736
00:29:30.375 --> 00:29:33.000
It's getting real cold out.

1352291491
00:29:46.667 --> 00:29:50.000
Let's go.

431553561
00:29:51.792 --> 00:29:53.250
So, where you guys from?

2750983777
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:54.292
Shut up. Keep walking.

152866266
00:29:54.292 --> 00:29:57.292
Gonna be a long hike
if we can't talk to each other.

4045050654
00:29:57.292 --> 00:29:58.999
It better not be a long hike.

333250216
00:29:58.999 --> 00:30:00.250
Friend's
pretty serious, ain't he?

1441459256
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.876
Well, I don't think
he's too happy

1931377360
00:30:01.876 --> 00:30:03.876
after getting stabbed
in the shoulder.

3187979556
00:30:03.876 --> 00:30:05.334
Well, it wasn't me.

622658069
00:30:05.334 --> 00:30:07.042
Eh, I don't blame him, though.

1958127013
00:30:07.042 --> 00:30:08.042
Getting stabbed sucks.

2597387063
00:30:08.042 --> 00:30:09.334
Hey, shut the up.

1958314709
00:30:25.209 --> 00:30:26.792
<i>Yeah, Reba, it's Bob.</i>

2412936374
00:30:26.792 --> 00:30:29.542
I was wondering
how Rosette is doing.

1281154132
00:30:29.542 --> 00:30:32.375
Realized I hadn't said
a proper goodbye.

3320840494
00:30:32.375 --> 00:30:32.918
I...

4121213293
00:30:32.918 --> 00:30:37.959
I don't know if dogs think about
that sort of thing, but, uh...

3464610966
00:30:38.459 --> 00:30:41.459
Anyway, I...

3265722872
00:30:42.584 --> 00:30:44.876
Thanks again for helping out.

2460826453
00:30:44.876 --> 00:30:46.709
Bye.

2359238708
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.584
Look at this.

2157484332
00:30:49.584 --> 00:30:50.542
Oh, no.

2805840466
00:30:50.542 --> 00:30:52.792
Look at this mess.

3118751012
00:30:52.792 --> 00:30:54.375
People don't have any respect.

3852900738
00:30:54.375 --> 00:30:56.792
This is gonna end up
in scat, this plastic.

1022668110
00:30:56.792 --> 00:30:57.918
I... Let me pick that up.

3750916772
00:30:57.918 --> 00:30:59.834
–All right. Thank you, Ranger.
–Dee Dee!

950130392
00:30:59.834 --> 00:31:02.042
– That is sticking.
– I got some oil in the car.

2463854014
00:31:02.042 --> 00:31:03.083
Dee Dee! Henry!

3509605315
00:31:03.083 --> 00:31:04.334
'Cause if that stays open,

3188859491
00:31:04.334 --> 00:31:06.584
–critters can get in there.
–Oh, yeah, critters.

1299857845
00:31:07.417 --> 00:31:09.000
What kind of critters? Huh?

1585306001
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.542
–Squirrels?
–Squirrels could get in there.

4114504865
00:31:10.542 --> 00:31:12.999
– Chipmunks?
– Yeah, chipmunks get in there.

3453107529
00:31:12.999 --> 00:31:14.292
– Dee Dee!
– Uh, skunks.

2234354450
00:31:14.292 --> 00:31:15.584
Raccoon, you know,
little burglar.

1962588617
00:31:15.584 --> 00:31:17.000
–That's right.
–Got his own little mask on.

2875020153
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.876
–Yeah, with their cute little
outfit. –I think they're cute.

1759684811
00:31:18.876 --> 00:31:20.083
Uh, skunks.

1152078735
00:31:20.083 --> 00:31:21.167
Skunks. Hmm.

2805223301
00:31:21.167 --> 00:31:22.209
– Possums.
– Possums.

977040783
00:31:22.209 --> 00:31:23.500
–Definitely possums.
–Possum.

3459090572
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.918
–Uh...
–Hey, possum.

821349609
00:31:24.918 --> 00:31:27.751
Mrs. McKinndry!

2236742499
00:31:27.751 --> 00:31:28.834
Henry?

3717059867
00:31:28.834 --> 00:31:30.876
Here! Hello?

1122624325
00:31:30.876 --> 00:31:31.834
Henry?

4176457125
00:31:31.834 --> 00:31:33.417
Up here!

3384366060
00:31:34.959 --> 00:31:36.792
– Hey. Whoa.
– Oh.

1831098623
00:31:36.792 --> 00:31:39.250
Henry, what are you
doing up there?

2756097133
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:39.792
No.

2698341298
00:31:39.792 --> 00:31:41.292
– No, that's not safe at all.
– No.

2342979958
00:31:41.292 --> 00:31:43.918
It's too high.
You got to come down.

895828344
00:31:43.918 --> 00:31:44.626
Get down here.

1269747647
00:31:44.626 --> 00:31:47.500
Don't be mad,
but we skipped school.

2223114879
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.417
– No shit, Henry.
– It's high.

3899235581
00:31:49.417 --> 00:31:50.751
But there was a bear.

2868271605
00:31:50.751 --> 00:31:52.042
A really terrible bear.

3743873601
00:31:52.042 --> 00:31:53.417
–A bear?
–Yeah, I know.

3155630509
00:31:53.417 --> 00:31:55.459
– It was cooked!
– Hey!

3397649768
00:31:55.459 --> 00:31:56.667
That's inappropriate.

1694719391
00:31:56.667 --> 00:32:00.709
Sorry for cussing,
but it attacked me and Dee Dee.

1025366285
00:32:00.709 --> 00:32:01.459
It attacked you?

1343305905
00:32:01.459 --> 00:32:03.667
– Henry, where is Dee Dee?
– No, no.

3464001234
00:32:03.667 --> 00:32:05.334
Bears are
very peaceful creatures.

3524068257
00:32:05.334 --> 00:32:06.999
You must have done something
to upset it.

2479797117
00:32:06.999 --> 00:32:09.083
–Yeah, did you feed it?
–What did you do?

614393838
00:32:09.083 --> 00:32:10.834
Nothing! Y'all need to hide!

1750761861
00:32:10.834 --> 00:32:13.959
I'm telling you,
it's not just any bear!

1810560224
00:32:13.959 --> 00:32:15.918
You have to listen to me!

3939372938
00:32:15.918 --> 00:32:17.667
Henry, where is Dee Dee?

3453048919
00:32:17.667 --> 00:32:18.542
The monster took her.

451929068
00:32:18.542 --> 00:32:22.375
Now, I'm not gonna
tell you again, little girl.

2297348670
00:32:22.375 --> 00:32:23.667
Get down here now.

2316929176
00:32:23.667 --> 00:32:26.209
A...

2424803028
00:32:26.209 --> 00:32:28.792
I...

1437811418
00:32:28.792 --> 00:32:30.209
Dee Dee!

1366524338
00:32:46.083 --> 00:32:49.000
Whoa!

3713202053
00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:51.250
Peter!

1155954772
00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.375
– No!
– Peter!

2450122418
00:32:57.209 --> 00:32:59.375
Oh! Oh, no!

4247221198
00:32:59.375 --> 00:33:00.792
It let me go! He ran off!

1294240966
00:33:00.792 --> 00:33:04.209
–Henry, jump down.
–It's too high.

2535531112
00:33:04.209 --> 00:33:05.709
Is it gone?

2449894392
00:33:05.709 --> 00:33:08.083
Do you see it?

3966375116
00:33:14.918 --> 00:33:15.876
Yeah.

1227598887
00:33:15.876 --> 00:33:18.083
Why are you shooting at me?

2457264047
00:33:18.083 --> 00:33:19.250
Get your ass down!

1597444438
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.542
This is your fault.

2827666945
00:33:20.542 --> 00:33:22.834
Right behind you. I saw it.

3736933390
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.042
Stay down.

852832759
00:33:32.959 --> 00:33:35.375
What?

1830550565
00:33:51.959 --> 00:33:53.709
Help me!

2421335163
00:33:53.999 --> 00:33:56.417
Help!

2273927024
00:33:59.667 --> 00:34:02.584
Ranger! Ranger!

4112082555
00:34:02.584 --> 00:34:03.834
Did it get you?

2195947938
00:34:03.834 --> 00:34:06.250
That !

4269867639
00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:07.375
I'm gonna get him.

1943858820
00:34:07.375 --> 00:34:09.083
I'm gonna get that bear.

2756741602
00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:13.167
I'll get help.

1136899131
00:34:13.167 --> 00:34:14.751
Where are you going?

2883102632
00:34:14.751 --> 00:34:16.292
God Almighty.

4199636768
00:34:16.292 --> 00:34:18.709
Hey. What...

3979102562
00:34:19.751 --> 00:34:21.584
Where is it?

3050991336
00:34:22.626 --> 00:34:24.751
Hey!

3082611388
00:34:26.542 --> 00:34:27.999
What should I do?

219596055
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.999
Come back! Help us!

1381268594
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.334
Oh,

3572966967
00:34:39.167 --> 00:34:40.709
There's something wrong with it.

1799488575
00:34:40.709 --> 00:34:42.042
Yeah, I told you there was.

254529341
00:34:42.042 --> 00:34:44.417
Why is it acting like this?

4162714700
00:34:44.417 --> 00:34:46.375
Did you feed it cocaine?

3214666424
00:34:46.375 --> 00:34:48.500
No. But you're safe.

977954165
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.334
Bears can't climb trees.

1104373057
00:34:50.334 --> 00:34:51.584
Of course they can!

3780858456
00:34:51.584 --> 00:34:53.834
Then why are you up here?

2895322765
00:35:18.042 --> 00:35:21.417
It's okay. It's okay.

4258799044
00:35:37.542 --> 00:35:39.667
Okay.

947021712
00:35:54.918 --> 00:35:56.500
No.

2985669383
00:35:58.209 --> 00:36:00.417
Henry, climb. Henry, go.

3136551702
00:36:00.417 --> 00:36:03.000
Climb! Climb!
You got to get higher!

3490898984
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
– Climb.
– Go, Henry!

1068931908
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.542
Go!

4046103667
00:36:06.584 --> 00:36:09.375
–Henry, move!
–Go higher!

499021369
00:36:11.042 --> 00:36:12.500
Go up!

3092723377
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.709
Henry, go!

1278028843
00:36:14.709 --> 00:36:16.876
Oh, God.

800934831
00:36:17.751 --> 00:36:19.709
– Go, Henry! No!
– Whoa!

4022084006
00:36:19.709 --> 00:36:20.918
No!

2113825526
00:36:20.918 --> 00:36:22.500
Oh, God. Henry!

3005857923
00:36:37.417 --> 00:36:39.250
Oh, God.

2535471159
00:36:40.834 --> 00:36:42.959
Oh, shit.

3990370634
00:36:45.667 --> 00:36:47.999
No, no, no, no!

1412174663
00:36:50.083 --> 00:36:52.417
Get off of me! No, no!

3934041703
00:36:52.417 --> 00:36:55.000
Get off! Get off of me!

1294543682
00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:02.500
Henry, jump! Jump down!

357377923
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.667
Move, Henry!

852775540
00:37:10.542 --> 00:37:12.918
It's okay. It's okay.
You're doing great.

375871594
00:37:12.918 --> 00:37:15.459
You're almost there.
Come on, baby.

3300819217
00:37:15.459 --> 00:37:18.083
Come on. Let's go.

597457738
00:37:18.083 --> 00:37:20.375
Come on.

2545411407
00:37:37.459 --> 00:37:40.709
Go. Hide. Come here. Come here.

3110119772
00:37:44.584 --> 00:37:46.834
That was so messed up.

312439291
00:37:46.834 --> 00:37:49.334
That little man
was an expert on bears

2963388666
00:37:49.334 --> 00:37:52.459
but didn't know the bear
was the cocaine bear.

928201233
00:37:52.459 --> 00:37:53.959
Wait. What did you say?

2566308309
00:37:53.959 --> 00:37:55.125
We found cocaine,
Mrs. McKinndry.

2511584627
00:37:55.125 --> 00:37:57.125
There was cocaine in the forest,
and the bear ate it

1782453402
00:37:57.125 --> 00:37:59.626
and then went crazy
on me and Dee Dee

3676582043
00:37:59.626 --> 00:38:02.042
and now on that guy back there.

2299003740
00:38:02.042 --> 00:38:04.000
Did you hear him scream?

1550542053
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.918
He's so dead.

3236902025
00:38:05.918 --> 00:38:08.542
I'd love to not remember that.

4118115257
00:38:08.542 --> 00:38:09.959
But it kind of seems like

2839985365
00:38:09.959 --> 00:38:13.334
the thing that stays
with a man forever.

2918366699
00:38:13.334 --> 00:38:17.000
Henry, when the bear
took Dee Dee, was she...

566008107
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.709
Alive? Yeah.

272050562
00:38:18.709 --> 00:38:21.042
It chased her that way.

3643567515
00:38:21.167 --> 00:38:23.042
We got to go. Let's go.

2567527217
00:38:25.709 --> 00:38:26.834
He get at you, too?

4294501856
00:38:26.834 --> 00:38:29.709
–Yeah, you can say that again.

3422282466
00:38:29.709 --> 00:38:33.250
–Call an ambulance.
–I already did.

4245605156
00:38:34.667 --> 00:38:36.292
Keep him awake.

4237045014
00:38:36.292 --> 00:38:39.334
Yeah, I've been trying.

675402707
00:38:53.375 --> 00:38:54.751
You piles of screw ups!

2226760988
00:38:54.751 --> 00:38:58.000
–You're the Doochamps!
–Hey, that's–that's not ours.

1236556114
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.083
We found it.

3321828043
00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:04.834
"It's not ours."

2247830903
00:39:05.167 --> 00:39:06.459
I'm a park ranger.

1506519029
00:39:06.459 --> 00:39:08.167
–I'm not dumb.
–I know.

2295423545
00:39:08.167 --> 00:39:10.000
They say I can't keep
my park safe,

1970337432
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.250
that I'm unfit
for the big leagues.

2125658719
00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:14.375
I'd have been
at Yellowstone by now

318755269
00:39:14.375 --> 00:39:15.584
if it weren't for you shits!

1269826549
00:39:15.584 --> 00:39:16.918
– Buds.
– Huh?

533156922
00:39:16.918 --> 00:39:19.417
There's someone outside.

2550036642
00:39:19.417 --> 00:39:22.375
It's him. Get to the door.
Get to the door.

2955584881
00:39:22.375 --> 00:39:23.334
Yeah.

3968060794
00:39:23.334 --> 00:39:26.959
Now, uh, open it
when I–I count to three.

2362737822
00:39:26.959 --> 00:39:29.125
Wait, wait.
But you're gonna shoot him?

1528394064
00:39:29.125 --> 00:39:30.417
Hell yes, I'm gonna shoot him!

1191187880
00:39:30.417 --> 00:39:31.709
He took a bite out of my ass!

1399074980
00:39:31.709 --> 00:39:35.000
What the is wrong
with this guy?

1614540158
00:39:35.626 --> 00:39:38.500
Now, open it when I say so.

3156839649
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.125
Now.

4160679793
00:39:44.083 --> 00:39:46.834
That's a bear.

1147482108
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.042
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

217268021
00:39:55.042 --> 00:39:56.250
–You're sorry?
–I'm sorry.

3631270989
00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:58.876
–Where'd the bear go?
–You killed him.

753287279
00:39:58.876 --> 00:39:59.667
Where's the bear?!

3221895544
00:39:59.667 --> 00:40:00.751
–I don't know!
–Close the door!

4037137620
00:40:00.751 --> 00:40:04.999
– Close the door.
– Jesus Christ.

1834777623
00:40:04.999 --> 00:40:08.000
Close the door.

596123651
00:40:08.584 --> 00:40:11.999
Oh, God. I'm sorry, bud.

330906081
00:40:16.542 --> 00:40:20.500
Keep your mouth shut.
Check over there.

2333653609
00:40:41.876 --> 00:40:43.959
Shh.

1485478486
00:40:46.667 --> 00:40:48.959
He's up there.

2838879444
00:40:48.959 --> 00:40:50.375
He's up there.

2175063814
00:41:19.167 --> 00:41:23.167
I got it. I got it.

728641330
00:41:32.083 --> 00:41:33.459
Maybe the kid can help you.

887549520
00:41:33.459 --> 00:41:35.959
Look, I'm done
playing this game.

3995173849
00:41:35.959 --> 00:41:37.417
–What game?
–20 questions.

661923583
00:41:37.417 --> 00:41:39.876
Daveed's so cold.
It's unbelievable.

2830461520
00:41:39.876 --> 00:41:42.709
–What did he ask so far?
–He just keeps guessing.

1738234201
00:41:42.709 --> 00:41:44.500
Like, "Is it a spider?

2321478496
00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.751
Is it an arrow?"

2813386565
00:41:46.751 --> 00:41:49.500
What are you, new?

1813807086
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.751
Hey, start broad,
then narrow it down.

3393409960
00:41:51.751 --> 00:41:52.751
Everybody knows that.

2329644750
00:41:52.751 --> 00:41:54.542
Look, are we close
to the gazebo?

3054834404
00:41:54.542 --> 00:41:56.083
Is that one of your questions?

4047806777
00:41:56.083 --> 00:41:57.834
Oh, is it bigger
than a bread box?

4164800307
00:41:57.834 --> 00:42:00.542
No, no, no. Daveed needs to ask.

2175997579
00:42:00.542 --> 00:42:03.918
Ask him if it's bigger
than a bread box.

3936258330
00:42:04.083 --> 00:42:07.417
Is it bigger than a bread box?

2366366852
00:42:07.999 --> 00:42:09.042
–Yes.
–Whoo!

2132074613
00:42:09.042 --> 00:42:10.459
Yeah!

336213632
00:42:10.459 --> 00:42:12.417
Is it Abraham Lincoln?

2234068750
00:42:12.417 --> 00:42:14.125
What? No.

3793343755
00:42:14.125 --> 00:42:17.250
Broad, then narrow it down, man.

212768716
00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:19.584
You have one question left.

2056974106
00:43:12.959 --> 00:43:15.792
Dee Dee! Dee Dee!

1411168828
00:43:15.792 --> 00:43:17.459
You sure this is the way?

2471064792
00:43:17.459 --> 00:43:20.000
Pretty sure.

3185990610
00:43:24.417 --> 00:43:26.292
Dee Dee! It's okay.

277028569
00:43:26.292 --> 00:43:28.292
It's Mama.

206274821
00:43:29.292 --> 00:43:31.584
Oh.

1937651243
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.250
Thank God.

3052712219
00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:35.334
Ew! What the heck?

2133819252
00:43:35.334 --> 00:43:37.042
It's paint. It's just red paint.

3881124327
00:43:37.042 --> 00:43:40.000
It looks a lot like blood.
How can you be sure?

2668101537
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.083
I'm a nurse, Henry.

1748219622
00:43:42.083 --> 00:43:44.209
Good point.

712346532
00:43:44.918 --> 00:43:46.999
Come on.

1902788059
00:43:50.584 --> 00:43:53.042
Oh, smart girl.

3623879582
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.083
Henry, come on.
She left us a trail.

1303028531
00:43:56.083 --> 00:43:59.959
Mrs. McKinndry,
have you ever done cocaine?

2829137640
00:43:59.959 --> 00:44:01.167
What?

3655312076
00:44:01.167 --> 00:44:02.999
Why do you ask?

330902038
00:44:02.999 --> 00:44:05.000
Just wondering if it has
long–term side effects––

3466026788
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.334
for the bear, of course,
if it just did a little bit.

746514079
00:44:08.334 --> 00:44:11.626
Well, it could create
a habit for the bear.

3730833759
00:44:11.626 --> 00:44:14.459
What if they never want
to do it again?

1572947896
00:44:14.459 --> 00:44:16.375
Oh, then it–it should be fine.

1200491138
00:44:16.375 --> 00:44:19.375
But Mama Bear and Papa Bear
would be very angry

2495571606
00:44:19.375 --> 00:44:22.042
because drugs––
especially cocaine––

2833604600
00:44:22.042 --> 00:44:23.751
are very, very bad.

649648124
00:44:23.751 --> 00:44:26.000
What if they would
never find out?

1097865693
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.292
Oh, Henry.

1500625558
00:44:27.292 --> 00:44:29.792
We always find out.

2744619557
00:44:29.792 --> 00:44:31.209
Dee Dee!

3129724435
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.584
Medic!

730474501
00:44:56.584 --> 00:44:58.042
Just open it.

3914153866
00:44:58.042 --> 00:44:59.167
Yeah, open it. You think?

1564179007
00:44:59.167 --> 00:45:01.292
– Can you just push?
– Harder. –

2808316924
00:45:01.292 --> 00:45:02.709
–I'm doing it as hard as...
–Just let...

2284602109
00:45:02.709 --> 00:45:04.459
–All right. You go.
–Let me do it.

3730379162
00:45:04.459 --> 00:45:05.167
You go. Yeah.

1484175831
00:45:05.167 --> 00:45:06.417
Please, show me how it's done.

1665712493
00:45:08.792 --> 00:45:10.250
Go ahead, Beth.
You're strong, right?

3079018591
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:12.959
Oh, yes, I am. Let me see.

2327200857
00:45:12.959 --> 00:45:14.459
What is that?

1455520897
00:45:14.459 --> 00:45:16.250
–See anything?
–Just, can you...

2922037835
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:17.542
–Can you help? Can you help?
–Yeah.

3839945404
00:45:17.542 --> 00:45:19.042
What happened to feminism, huh?
Is that dead?

4242590662
00:45:19.042 --> 00:45:21.709
– Come on.
– Wait. Okay, wait, wait, wait.

140842753
00:45:24.292 --> 00:45:25.250
Oh,

3702934848
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:26.500
Come on.

1488292830
00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:28.167
God, I'm trying.

1081010505
00:45:28.167 --> 00:45:30.167
Come on, push.

1049675671
00:45:30.167 --> 00:45:30.876
I'm trying.

2154000166
00:45:30.876 --> 00:45:33.918
You said they called in
a concussion.

2413178000
00:45:35.167 --> 00:45:37.250
They did.

2073776432
00:45:40.918 --> 00:45:42.292
Jesus.

4095827670
00:45:42.292 --> 00:45:44.000
This guy's been shot.

3185070299
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.584
Yeah. Obviously.

45209611
00:45:47.334 --> 00:45:49.167
Holy shit.

2360110660
00:45:49.167 --> 00:45:50.042
It's the ranger.

647387174
00:45:50.042 --> 00:45:51.375
Tom.

2213161868
00:45:51.375 --> 00:45:53.918
Come here. She's got a gun.

1047350559
00:45:55.292 --> 00:45:57.792
Tom! Hello?

3974714228
00:45:58.918 --> 00:46:02.042
No, no. Put that down.
Put that down.

916696364
00:46:02.042 --> 00:46:02.709
It's okay.

3176725702
00:46:02.709 --> 00:46:05.876
–B...
–Did you shoot that guy?

3036982788
00:46:05.876 --> 00:46:08.834
B... B...

2553106420
00:46:08.834 --> 00:46:10.375
"Buh"?

2443280799
00:46:18.542 --> 00:46:21.999
B... B...

1372864662
00:46:33.375 --> 00:46:34.334
Beth?

1569215186
00:46:34.334 --> 00:46:38.000
It's okay. It's okay. Calm.

1405242971
00:46:43.292 --> 00:46:45.167
Uh...

1172708466
00:47:04.959 --> 00:47:07.667
Beth, we should go.

991801647
00:47:07.834 --> 00:47:10.417
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

2457298346
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.125
Bear.

3294446608
00:47:20.626 --> 00:47:22.667
Bear.

1832568464
00:47:24.918 --> 00:47:26.999
Let's go.

846950181
00:47:26.999 --> 00:47:29.292
Tom, get up!

3765634985
00:47:32.918 --> 00:47:35.417
Don't look back.
Don't look back.

423179957
00:47:40.167 --> 00:47:42.709
Hang on. Push.

3773197069
00:47:47.292 --> 00:47:47.959
Oh,

2025812115
00:47:47.959 --> 00:47:50.375
Sorry. Sorry.

3457322703
00:47:55.999 --> 00:47:57.334
Come on. Come on.

3751679815
00:47:57.334 --> 00:47:58.626
Anybody else surprised by

3563278966
00:47:58.626 --> 00:48:00.626
that rain this morning?
I know I was.

1698868701
00:48:00.626 --> 00:48:02.083
Leave him!

1205630488
00:48:18.584 --> 00:48:20.000
Our next story, the weather

150439770
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.584
–at the top of the hour,
but first... –Go! Drive!

...more of your favorite hits
here on 103.7 BOB FM.

2601893525
00:48:26.459 --> 00:48:28.542
–Tom, get in!
–Wait! Wait!

4141973342
00:48:28.542 --> 00:48:31.083
–Wait!
–Oh, God.

1900498755
00:48:32.375 --> 00:48:34.375
Oh,

2933351003
00:48:34.375 --> 00:48:37.167
Oh! Jesus, Beth,
I wasn't even on yet.

4093093675
00:48:37.167 --> 00:48:40.125
What is wrong
with that bear?

2530439957
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:44.125
What
have you got a gun for?

1253090904
00:48:44.125 --> 00:48:45.542
Hey, move! Move!

3340367501
00:48:45.542 --> 00:48:46.250
Put that away!

3615789912
00:48:49.417 --> 00:48:52.584
Jesus Christ!
Shoot it! Shoot it!

179008599
00:48:53.918 --> 00:48:55.667
– Oh!
– Kill it!

2612451955
00:48:55.667 --> 00:48:56.375
Not the tree!

3935523411
00:48:56.375 --> 00:48:57.959
–The big bear!
–Shut up!

806434477
00:48:57.959 --> 00:48:59.083
Why is it chasing us?

3624051563
00:49:00.834 --> 00:49:02.709
Tom, try to shut
the door!

37710233
00:49:02.709 --> 00:49:05.000
Close the door!

1348978443
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.167
Guys, you got to stop
yelling at me!

1388094336
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Oh.

3760144404
00:49:14.125 --> 00:49:16.834
Beth, speed up!

2102590099
00:50:15.209 --> 00:50:17.834
I don't know
how to talk to him, you know.

3781553288
00:50:17.834 --> 00:50:23.167
Like, what–what do you say to
a kid who just lost his mommy?

2082600990
00:50:23.167 --> 00:50:26.667
My mom is the reason
I'm the man I am today.

1944024889
00:50:26.667 --> 00:50:27.876
And what a man you are.

1511105414
00:50:27.876 --> 00:50:30.250
Attacking innocent people
for no reason.

1045409798
00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:31.292
Can you not?

824848952
00:50:31.292 --> 00:50:33.417
I'm sorry. Just continue.

3445191227
00:50:33.417 --> 00:50:35.083
Well, when my daddy died,

1221694792
00:50:35.083 --> 00:50:37.125
my mama bought me
this pet lizard.

2476109526
00:50:37.125 --> 00:50:39.167
It was
the coolest little thing.

2250329113
00:50:39.167 --> 00:50:41.292
It had all these
green scales on it.

2869475650
00:50:41.292 --> 00:50:43.667
She used to call it
a tiny dinosaur.

4027646527
00:50:43.667 --> 00:50:45.083
I thought that was so awesome.

3589693505
00:50:45.083 --> 00:50:47.667
I was real bad
at connecting with people,

1892010166
00:50:47.667 --> 00:50:49.667
but I practiced
conversation starters

1921711353
00:50:49.667 --> 00:50:50.876
on that lizard every day.

646602500
00:50:50.876 --> 00:50:53.167
And then
that's how I met Rocky and Joe.

3495824487
00:50:54.626 --> 00:50:55.542
That's my team, man.

2221239465
00:50:55.542 --> 00:50:59.751
We're planning on moving
to New York City together.

3852046269
00:50:59.751 --> 00:51:02.918
Those are my buds, man.

1180049149
00:51:02.918 --> 00:51:05.500
So I should get Gabe a lizard?

2307358057
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.042
Well, you know what?

453318454
00:51:08.042 --> 00:51:11.834
Lizards are good listeners, bud,

108256786
00:51:11.834 --> 00:51:13.500
but people...

3083744154
00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:16.792
people are good at hearing.

131632392
00:51:19.334 --> 00:51:22.792
That's the sweetest thing
I ever heard. Thank you.

4264124062
00:51:22.792 --> 00:51:24.125
–Can we...
–It's okay.

4105157683
00:51:24.125 --> 00:51:26.751
Y'all are hugging.

389541667
00:51:26.751 --> 00:51:29.500
It's okay.

86025126
00:51:31.459 --> 00:51:33.584
Where is the gazebo?

2198204440
00:52:43.167 --> 00:52:48.125
Can I say something without you
getting angry with me?

4256754879
00:52:48.626 --> 00:52:51.542
I'm already angry with you.

2240872443
00:52:54.292 --> 00:52:56.542
It's gone.

2143691794
00:52:56.751 --> 00:52:57.542
What the actual...

4016359570
00:52:57.542 --> 00:52:59.000
– No! Please, please!
– Daveed, stop.

228241760
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.667
No, no, no. The kid's
messing with us, Eddie.

1166053738
00:53:00.667 --> 00:53:01.959
No, no, no! I'm not!
I'm not! I'm not!

1920791971
00:53:01.959 --> 00:53:04.083
I–I promise.
I–I don't know where it went.

1464968188
00:53:04.083 --> 00:53:04.876
It's just gone.

3678210076
00:53:04.876 --> 00:53:06.876
Okay, well,
duffel bags don't have legs.

3143152655
00:53:06.876 --> 00:53:09.250
Since you're the only one
that knew where it was,

2133883490
00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:11.834
I'm–a give you one more chance.

898598311
00:53:11.834 --> 00:53:13.167
Where's the ba...

3401185598
00:53:13.334 --> 00:53:17.250
Put the gun down
and move away from the teenager.

2040392537
00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:22.083
Drop the weapon and step away
about five to ten paces.

329711117
00:53:22.083 --> 00:53:24.999
All right, listen.
Just calm down, all right?

3880894760
00:53:24.999 --> 00:53:27.000
I ain't messing around.

3252999994
00:53:27.334 --> 00:53:30.083
Just do it.

611845123
00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:35.584
–You don't want to do this.
–Shut up!

93930100
00:53:35.584 --> 00:53:38.834
I'm coming down there.

3162302845
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.334
Uh...

1675800273
00:53:49.334 --> 00:53:50.709
Uh...

2397853321
00:53:50.709 --> 00:53:53.375
Uh...

1445587754
00:53:53.999 --> 00:53:57.209
Uh...

3383391646
00:53:57.209 --> 00:53:57.792
Shh!

2524287059
00:53:57.792 --> 00:53:59.542
I'm just trying to...

4041791690
00:53:59.542 --> 00:54:01.709
find a safe spot to hop down.

3214850363
00:54:01.709 --> 00:54:02.918
How did you get up there?

1059685315
00:54:02.918 --> 00:54:05.584
Well, I jumped from that tree
over there, but...

1362571485
00:54:05.584 --> 00:54:06.792
I hurt my hip a little.

2784966219
00:54:06.792 --> 00:54:08.250
I can try to catch you
if you want.

2013781893
00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:12.834
No, no!
You stay right where you are!

2728028338
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:14.918
Let's, uh, see, uh...

51327955
00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:15.959
Get it.

348201607
00:54:22.918 --> 00:54:24.375
Well, you brought that
on yourself, kid.

4092860558
00:54:24.375 --> 00:54:27.459
Oh, yeah?
I shot my own fingers?

3756868520
00:54:27.459 --> 00:54:28.667
I told you not to move.

2100720642
00:54:28.667 --> 00:54:31.709
How'd he take
those two fingers off?

3911493273
00:54:31.709 --> 00:54:34.000
They're not even
next to each other.

4067189462
00:54:38.209 --> 00:54:39.834
Come out of there!

3495106099
00:54:39.834 --> 00:54:41.542
Come on out!

432959695
00:54:41.542 --> 00:54:43.751
No way!

2311147939
00:54:44.834 --> 00:54:47.042
God!

3706078471
00:54:47.626 --> 00:54:49.584
You two, on your bellies.

809137685
00:54:49.584 --> 00:54:52.250
Now! And no more moving.

1354294218
00:54:52.834 --> 00:54:54.459
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

1464586919
00:54:54.459 --> 00:54:55.751
Can you grab them for me?

3969443313
00:54:55.751 --> 00:54:56.999
Can I grab his fingers?

3863607059
00:54:56.999 --> 00:54:59.292
Okay. Get 'em. Get 'em.

3312942202
00:54:59.959 --> 00:55:02.209
Slow. Slow.

3881507516
00:55:04.626 --> 00:55:05.542
Easy.

807651746
00:55:05.542 --> 00:55:07.626
Ugh, God.

2936779485
00:55:08.709 --> 00:55:10.125
All right.

2843903674
00:55:10.125 --> 00:55:11.751
Now, you get back on your belly.

4141673744
00:55:11.751 --> 00:55:13.876
I'll hold on to these.

87149934
00:55:19.209 --> 00:55:21.167
Now, where you at?

452487200
00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:26.209
What?

155200188
00:55:26.209 --> 00:55:28.542
Oh, no. The river.

505028168
00:55:30.125 --> 00:55:31.667
Henry, look.

2979285333
00:55:31.667 --> 00:55:33.417
That's Dee Dee's sweater.

452082027
00:55:33.417 --> 00:55:35.584
–Come on.
–So we're crossing?

3994434621
00:55:35.584 --> 00:55:37.709
We're on the right track.

1403503127
00:55:37.709 --> 00:55:39.918
I can feel it.

1117080604
00:55:54.542 --> 00:55:57.250
Mama?

2189547139
00:56:01.459 --> 00:56:04.459
My jersey, man.

1704736152
00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:07.834
How long are you gonna
keep us like this?

3094419429
00:56:07.834 --> 00:56:09.209
Until that guy in the gazebo

3880648559
00:56:09.209 --> 00:56:10.959
throws his weapon
into the woods.

3811948978
00:56:10.959 --> 00:56:12.626
Well, then we'll be here
forever.

2723832452
00:56:12.626 --> 00:56:15.167
Hasn't Syd already
messed your life up enough?

4118105652
00:56:15.167 --> 00:56:17.375
We don't need to die
because of this.

896913777
00:56:17.375 --> 00:56:19.209
Eddie, I got this.

4168754147
00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:20.083
Do you?

2800563875
00:56:20.083 --> 00:56:23.000
I have your fingers
in my pocket.

3729382491
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.167
You're all gonna get arrested.

1828326494
00:56:24.167 --> 00:56:26.834
Drug sentences since Nixon
are screwed,

1567350612
00:56:26.834 --> 00:56:29.125
so get ready for ten to 15 years

470710645
00:56:29.125 --> 00:56:31.417
of shitting
in front of your cellmate

1529239623
00:56:31.417 --> 00:56:32.751
and supervised shower time.

3584695329
00:56:32.751 --> 00:56:35.584
Detective, Your Honor, sir,
I'm not with them.

753129295
00:56:35.584 --> 00:56:36.709
I've never even done coke.

2952000040
00:56:36.709 --> 00:56:39.626
I mean, maybe once.
Once–– at a party once.

4220764020
00:56:39.626 --> 00:56:41.876
–I can't go to jail.
–You're not going to jail.

1992333856
00:56:41.876 --> 00:56:43.250
Just saying, I can't shit
in front of people.

2801106802
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:45.584
I've never been able to shit
in front of people.

3682821180
00:56:45.584 --> 00:56:47.626
I like to shit in peace.

1050328944
00:56:52.918 --> 00:56:55.459
Nobody move.

2868132362
00:56:56.417 --> 00:56:57.459
It's a bear.

832782296
00:56:57.459 --> 00:56:59.292
Yeah.

1352991013
00:56:59.292 --> 00:57:00.459
No, no.

1771485451
00:57:00.459 --> 00:57:04.125
I'm not falling
for none of your...

2119847137
00:57:25.542 --> 00:57:26.250
Oh.

410546675
00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:28.417
Hey, y'all just stay still.
Don't move.

1863255366
00:57:28.417 --> 00:57:30.667
Just play dead.

1515352670
00:57:55.167 --> 00:57:57.083
Shh.

4033339722
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:23.792
Oh.

585197173
00:58:31.876 --> 00:58:32.999
Oh, man. You screwed.

2235495235
00:58:32.999 --> 00:58:33.918
Eddie, can you breathe?

2860204840
00:58:33.918 --> 00:58:35.999
What?

1234363979
00:58:35.999 --> 00:58:38.083
I think that's a yes.

1397981107
00:58:38.083 --> 00:58:39.876
Can someone do something?

1988028543
00:58:39.876 --> 00:58:41.292
Maybe your boy can do something.

979844300
00:58:41.292 --> 00:58:44.292
Can you just, like... move it?

966165775
00:58:44.292 --> 00:58:48.375
Oh, of course.
Why didn't I think of that?

4092325258
00:58:51.417 --> 00:58:52.375
Dee Dee!

3645459232
00:58:52.375 --> 00:58:56.584
Henry, stay close.
I haven't seen paint in a while.

3606646761
00:58:58.083 --> 00:58:59.959
Oh, God.

2367173387
00:58:59.959 --> 00:59:01.834
Look.

3808150742
00:59:01.834 --> 00:59:03.918
Hello.

2844150846
00:59:04.334 --> 00:59:08.042
Is he okay?

1054289955
00:59:08.042 --> 00:59:10.667
Help me, please.

3622977484
00:59:10.667 --> 00:59:12.542
Does he have food?

439796058
00:59:12.542 --> 00:59:14.876
Her name was Elsa,

3789738598
00:59:14.876 --> 00:59:17.292
and she was so beautiful.

2321991149
00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:20.125
Are–are you... are you hurt?

10288343
00:59:20.125 --> 00:59:22.459
Were you attacked?

1671302589
00:59:22.459 --> 00:59:24.584
Devil bear.

2594754263
00:59:24.584 --> 00:59:25.709
My... I'm looking
for my daughter.

1977731761
00:59:25.709 --> 00:59:27.292
She was attacked
by the devil bear.

603280806
00:59:27.292 --> 00:59:28.584
Have you seen her?

2413228298
00:59:28.584 --> 00:59:29.584
You have?

622421081
00:59:29.584 --> 00:59:31.417
– Was she alive?
– Yes.

1290290462
00:59:31.417 --> 00:59:33.083
Please, can you just point
to where she went?

2562119266
00:59:33.083 --> 00:59:35.417
Please, can you show me?
I'm looking for her.

1217728879
00:59:35.417 --> 00:59:36.542
I haven't...

1469481380
00:59:36.542 --> 00:59:38.334
Henry!

1119367165
00:59:49.792 --> 00:59:51.209
I'll show you.

1284828244
00:59:51.209 --> 00:59:53.918
I'll show you. Come.

1386991874
00:59:58.584 --> 01:00:00.375
It's not moving.

2248591130
01:00:01.751 --> 01:00:03.167
I think it died.

980889586
01:00:03.167 --> 01:00:05.667
It died on top of me?

1501497854
01:00:05.667 --> 01:00:06.334
Check its pulse.

519201506
01:00:06.334 --> 01:00:08.999
Can you, like,
feel it breathing?

3269513208
01:00:08.999 --> 01:00:11.959
I'm not sure.

1521364140
01:00:12.959 --> 01:00:15.417
Uh, hey, guy?

969365734
01:00:15.417 --> 01:00:16.334
Detective.

2758134032
01:00:16.334 --> 01:00:17.167
Can we call a truce

3987201919
01:00:17.167 --> 01:00:19.542
so I can see
if the bear is dead?

194643930
01:00:19.542 --> 01:00:21.209
Yeah.

2344614717
01:00:30.709 --> 01:00:32.000
You okay?

1374825512
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.959
What do you think?

3857955830
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.584
S–Still breathing.

4191615914
01:00:52.584 --> 01:00:54.751
We should go.

2068917256
01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:57.042
He'll probably be all right.

552757087
01:00:57.042 --> 01:00:59.125
What the hell, man?

811173115
01:00:59.125 --> 01:01:00.167
He's gonna wake up eventually.

3180211370
01:01:00.167 --> 01:01:02.542
Well, that's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

2781888258
01:01:02.542 --> 01:01:04.042
"She."

3821088489
01:01:04.042 --> 01:01:04.918
What?

3660272217
01:01:04.918 --> 01:01:06.500
The bear is a girl.

1859545860
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.000
Oh, yeah.
H–How do you know that?

3211101988
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.959
Because its vagina
is on my ear.

815414269
01:01:13.209 --> 01:01:15.125
Oh. She's moving.

3709304346
01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:15.999
She's awake.

2410668938
01:01:15.999 --> 01:01:18.709
Well, stay back. Stay back.

3527511961
01:01:18.709 --> 01:01:21.709
Okay.

3375195877
01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:26.834
Chill out. Just chill out!

4129205886
01:01:26.834 --> 01:01:28.417
Ooh. Homes, hey, hey.

3335040314
01:01:28.417 --> 01:01:31.000
Stay back.

459802969
01:01:34.417 --> 01:01:35.709
What?

249111874
01:01:35.709 --> 01:01:38.999
Okay. Okay.

2333537543
01:01:40.417 --> 01:01:43.999
No, no, no, no.
Don't eat that. Don't eat that.

109175299
01:01:44.125 --> 01:01:46.000
I will be goddamned.

3398611448
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:46.876
Should we shoot her?

2972963372
01:01:46.876 --> 01:01:51.000
No. Let's see what kind
of effect that has on it.

1648879348
01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:55.167
What?

523641732
01:02:06.459 --> 01:02:08.876
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1822589820
01:02:08.876 --> 01:02:10.999
– Eddie!
– Daveed, help.

1183767860
01:02:10.999 --> 01:02:13.500
What is this?

2539441139
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.292
No, no.

297889690
01:02:14.292 --> 01:02:16.584
– Ooh! Okay, I have...
– What is it doing?

878519910
01:02:16.584 --> 01:02:18.334
I–I don't like this.

2564138304
01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:19.000
Please stop.

2612278026
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.959
–Just go limp! Slide down!
–I'm limp already.

290913149
01:02:22.834 --> 01:02:25.042
– Shoot the bear! Shoot her!
– Don't shoot!

4031641267
01:02:25.042 --> 01:02:27.000
No, no. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

912658825
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.542
Eddie, you got to fight back,
all right?

1100503574
01:02:28.542 --> 01:02:29.542
It's–it's playing with you.

1725532936
01:02:29.542 --> 01:02:31.250
I'd stay still if I were you.

2554198863
01:02:31.292 --> 01:02:33.292
Bud, just tap out, bud.
Bud, tap out!

1706728252
01:02:33.292 --> 01:02:36.334
Eddie, please don't die
like this. Eddie, please.

1667717057
01:02:36.334 --> 01:02:37.250
Daveed!

2950284925
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:39.083
All we've been through! Come on!

1491563778
01:02:39.083 --> 01:02:40.250
Come on, help him!

1287774877
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:42.000
Get lower. You're not listening!

3265618696
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.500
Eddie.

3278094437
01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.042
Oh, my God. He's gonna die.

824892786
01:02:48.751 --> 01:02:49.584
No!

2525056387
01:02:49.584 --> 01:02:51.918
Hey, girl.

3821815074
01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:01.959
There you go, girl.

714128760
01:03:02.417 --> 01:03:04.500
There you go.

3647210204
01:03:05.584 --> 01:03:06.834
There you go.

529002136
01:03:06.834 --> 01:03:10.751
It's like cocaine Christmas.

352487878
01:03:25.167 --> 01:03:25.834
Go!

2454629912
01:03:25.834 --> 01:03:29.542
Don't have to tell me twice.

1102459001
01:03:31.584 --> 01:03:32.999
Come on!

4224770322
01:03:32.999 --> 01:03:33.667
Daveed!

4159173456
01:03:33.667 --> 01:03:34.792
That bag's worth 14 million.

3095451358
01:03:34.792 --> 01:03:37.792
We had a truce, and a truce
is on God where I'm from.

3113897257
01:03:37.792 --> 01:03:41.918
Can't you see I'm trying
to help you, kid? Go!

2525889148
01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:42.999
I need that bag.

546385564
01:03:42.999 --> 01:03:44.959
Leave it, man.
Let's just go home.

283851089
01:03:44.959 --> 01:03:48.459
We're taking that bag
to Syd, Eddie.

2402867082
01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:59.959
Shot...

2828314843
01:04:01.209 --> 01:04:03.667
No. I didn't.

214669722
01:04:07.042 --> 01:04:09.542
Run! Go, go!

2814239209
01:04:10.918 --> 01:04:12.959
Oh!

3483309902
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.584
– Dad. What are you doing here?

3649529236
01:04:29.584 --> 01:04:30.292
Where's Gabe?

2005283465
01:04:30.292 --> 01:04:31.667
You didn't bring him here,
did you?

1009655467
01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.334
Calm down.

2065421835
01:04:33.334 --> 01:04:35.167
He's safe at home watching TV.

2936285477
01:04:35.167 --> 01:04:37.334
What?
How long has he been alone?

570676419
01:04:37.334 --> 01:04:38.375
You left him with me!

806168592
01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:42.250
Do I look like
"daddy day care center" to you?

3146093163
01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:44.918
Huh?

4282183219
01:04:44.918 --> 01:04:47.709
–The happened to you?
–A lot.

557769103
01:04:47.709 --> 01:04:50.500
–Did you get the coke?
–A little.

2105506338
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.459
The bear ate most of it.

1063943341
01:04:52.459 --> 01:04:54.375
–What?
–The bear.

3362649102
01:04:54.375 --> 01:04:56.500
It did cocaine.

3767896460
01:04:57.918 --> 01:05:00.125
A bear did cocaine, Dad!

793966960
01:05:00.125 --> 01:05:00.834
Screw this!

1483194565
01:05:00.834 --> 01:05:03.834
Seriously, screw
this entire journey.

2377682733
01:05:03.834 --> 01:05:05.792
Eddie, Eddie, just calm down.

3180472790
01:05:05.792 --> 01:05:08.709
Look at me. Look at me.

632345888
01:05:08.709 --> 01:05:10.209
I'm on the hook here.

1942189519
01:05:10.209 --> 01:05:15.083
A lot of cocaine was lost
under my eye.

1059715363
01:05:15.083 --> 01:05:16.584
And the people that I deal with,

2218680503
01:05:16.584 --> 01:05:19.375
they don't care how,
just that it was.

1502279311
01:05:19.375 --> 01:05:20.918
And look at me.

2188470449
01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:24.000
They're gonna come after me,
my family

2152129957
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.834
if I don't get them
every penny's worth.

2916248036
01:05:27.834 --> 01:05:29.709
You hear what I'm saying?

1773827088
01:05:29.709 --> 01:05:32.584
It's you and Gabe.

1715301233
01:05:32.584 --> 01:05:35.042
You understand?

1720851123
01:05:36.334 --> 01:05:39.417
We don't have a choice.

3753160243
01:05:40.083 --> 01:05:42.751
There's a bag
with the cop and the bear

3706231145
01:05:42.751 --> 01:05:45.542
over at the pavilion structure.

623735265
01:05:47.042 --> 01:05:48.709
Come on.

2100223536
01:05:51.125 --> 01:05:53.751
Come on, son. Come on.

2525051298
01:06:00.042 --> 01:06:01.999
Who's there?

2079651067
01:06:01.999 --> 01:06:04.083
– Easy.
– Stay away.

2162464479
01:06:04.083 --> 01:06:05.542
Where's the duffel?

1480372017
01:06:05.542 --> 01:06:07.167
I gave it to the bear.

875819818
01:06:07.167 --> 01:06:08.959
You gave it to the bear?

49588134
01:06:08.959 --> 01:06:11.876
Yeah. The bear.

2725515732
01:06:12.167 --> 01:06:14.209
It loves coke.

1147051391
01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.250
Wh–Which way did it go?

3667614108
01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:18.542
I'm not screwing around here.

2486641048
01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:20.375
Syd White.

3033894603
01:06:20.375 --> 01:06:23.292
Man, I've been following you
for years.

301184969
01:06:23.292 --> 01:06:24.417
They all have.

630262436
01:06:29.584 --> 01:06:31.834
Reba.

966101823
01:06:31.834 --> 01:06:34.667
Oh, I always knew
you were my girl.

1638762088
01:06:34.667 --> 01:06:35.375
I got you now.

2429660143
01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:37.626
Be careful
when you cuff these guys.

2332444201
01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:39.876
They're kind of shifty.

2481347101
01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:45.626
What...

1849386722
01:06:45.626 --> 01:06:47.792
What are you doing?

3088634462
01:06:49.334 --> 01:06:52.751
– I'm sorry, Bob.
– I'm sorry, Bob.

3101601569
01:06:52.751 --> 01:06:54.459
You shot him?

3279151798
01:06:54.459 --> 01:06:55.751
I told you not to hurt him.

3344802394
01:06:55.751 --> 01:06:57.209
I don't work for you.

655882275
01:06:57.209 --> 01:06:58.667
The department trusted you.

788762221
01:06:58.667 --> 01:07:01.959
The state of Tennessee
trusted you.

13876403
01:07:01.959 --> 01:07:07.292
The United States of America,
it trusted you.

474849922
01:07:07.292 --> 01:07:08.417
I know.

2288256479
01:07:08.417 --> 01:07:11.125
–I trusted you with Rosette.
–I know.

1102694054
01:07:11.125 --> 01:07:12.918
Who's Rosette?

419767374
01:07:12.918 --> 01:07:13.999
The dog in my car.

2624883735
01:07:13.999 --> 01:07:15.209
You left a dog in the car?

1497149775
01:07:15.209 --> 01:07:17.500
You left my son in Saint Louis.

3107233876
01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.834
How is she?

3764789165
01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:28.125
She being a good girl?

3025635719
01:07:28.125 --> 01:07:31.000
Yeah. She's such a good girl.

3460223312
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.167
E–Enough.

910597477
01:07:32.167 --> 01:07:33.709
Tell me which way the bear went,

3587256325
01:07:33.709 --> 01:07:36.292
or I'm gonna kill the dog
when I come down mountain.

2361264376
01:07:36.292 --> 01:07:38.959
Oh, no, no, please,
d–don't–don't do that.

3029743266
01:07:38.959 --> 01:07:41.417
I'd vote for not
killing the dog today,

138083602
01:07:41.417 --> 01:07:43.000
but that's just me.

431315279
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.584
Well, what do you guys say?

317125198
01:07:44.584 --> 01:07:47.334
What's so funny?

680423646
01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:50.999
Apex predator,

1490191033
01:07:50.999 --> 01:07:54.709
high on cocaine,
and you're going towards it.

1174107352
01:08:01.042 --> 01:08:02.667
Dead north, man.

3388109614
01:08:02.667 --> 01:08:04.584
Yes, we will.

2140482783
01:08:04.584 --> 01:08:07.500
Dead... dead north.

2675392821
01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.751
Let's go.

655713970
01:08:48.459 --> 01:08:51.250
The devil bear is in there.

4290129060
01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:53.999
You can't go in there.

1988452133
01:08:53.999 --> 01:08:56.250
Do you have kids?

1863338024
01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:57.667
We would have.

3196184188
01:08:57.667 --> 01:08:59.167
I have to go find mine.

4000453721
01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:01.959
And his name would be Texas.

1445193900
01:09:01.959 --> 01:09:04.542
–Do you have a flashlight?
–Yeah.

1377428061
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.999
Here.

194922865
01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:12.417
Thank you.

1416737150
01:09:12.417 --> 01:09:15.042
Bye, lady and little man.

2132985373
01:09:15.042 --> 01:09:17.334
Bye, you both.

4271755612
01:09:18.667 --> 01:09:20.042
Okay.

1476499018
01:09:20.042 --> 01:09:23.000
Wait. What about me?

23661582
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.209
Watch where you step.

3569120732
01:09:45.834 --> 01:09:49.292
I got you. Stay close.

3950612932
01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:53.626
What's that?

4212304427
01:09:57.792 --> 01:09:59.042
Don't move.

1523026658
01:09:59.042 --> 01:10:01.209
Stay still, Henry.

358538701
01:10:06.334 --> 01:10:08.375
They look like polar bears.

3571193936
01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:09.834
Henry?

3873716280
01:10:09.834 --> 01:10:10.542
Dee Dee?

1889425095
01:10:10.542 --> 01:10:11.500
– Dee Dee?
– Mama!

15874894
01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.042
Don't move. I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

3894065216
01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:15.584
–No, no. Them, they're...
they're harmless. –Dee Dee!

318133836
01:10:15.584 --> 01:10:18.667
–Mama, I just...
–Baby!

1348059003
01:10:18.667 --> 01:10:19.999
Dee Dee, you're okay.

4180214669
01:10:19.999 --> 01:10:20.999
Are you hurt?

2042062689
01:10:20.999 --> 01:10:22.292
– It's just my leg.
– Your leg?

2551303151
01:10:22.292 --> 01:10:23.500
That looks really deep.

4105860379
01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:26.083
– Here. Don't touch it.
– Ow! Ow! Henry!

4259348343
01:10:26.083 --> 01:10:27.167
Let's keep you warm.

1589607923
01:10:27.167 --> 01:10:29.042
Oh, my gosh.
You found my sweater.

4216345132
01:10:29.042 --> 01:10:30.042
You smart girl.

541019613
01:10:30.042 --> 01:10:32.000
–You left us clues.
–Yeah.

1797186015
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.459
We found you.

3524953828
01:10:33.459 --> 01:10:34.250
Put that on.

3846465341
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:37.667
–Mom, I'm so sorry.
–Oh, I love you so much.

929663058
01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:39.000
Oh, my God.

218272144
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.125
Mom, I'm–I'm so sorry.

4084603509
01:10:40.125 --> 01:10:41.542
–I'm sorry. I just...
–It's okay.

2637506432
01:10:41.542 --> 01:10:42.709
Henry told me everything.

4086426384
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:43.709
Everything?

3423512149
01:10:43.709 --> 01:10:45.083
You mean that
you guys did drugs?

1214296174
01:10:45.083 --> 01:10:46.292
– You told her?
– No.

3536103559
01:10:46.292 --> 01:10:48.167
I had a suspicion,
and you just confirmed it.

42321883
01:10:48.167 --> 01:10:50.500
I'm just so glad I found you
and you're okay.

590342433
01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:54.792
Um, what was that?

1451198018
01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:57.209
Cocaine bear's back.

2247148217
01:10:57.209 --> 01:10:59.125
–Can you walk?
–Uh, a little.

1443042284
01:10:59.125 --> 01:11:00.709
Come on. Let's go, Henry.

3137587462
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:02.125
Go that way.

2353296038
01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:02.918
Go ahead.

4211020195
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:06.459
It's okay. Come on.

1817675743
01:11:06.459 --> 01:11:08.834
Look. It's a way out.

2900680165
01:11:11.375 --> 01:11:14.918
– It's the falls.
– Oh, wow.

917374716
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:25.959
Henry, stay away from the ledge!

3121275428
01:11:25.959 --> 01:11:28.250
Oh, God.

481252681
01:12:14.334 --> 01:12:16.999
This is it.

4209400941
01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:20.667
Syd, let's cut our losses.

950482493
01:12:20.667 --> 01:12:23.042
All right? Let's just deal
with the fallout.

3634149246
01:12:23.042 --> 01:12:26.626
You saw what that bear did
to that hiker.

214139953
01:12:29.542 --> 01:12:32.167
What is that?

1864915247
01:12:32.834 --> 01:12:34.125
Oh

28931527
01:12:34.125 --> 01:12:37.334
What the? What the?

242540429
01:12:38.667 --> 01:12:41.167
Come on.

3969311960
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.375
Eddie.

2119411847
01:12:47.375 --> 01:12:49.918
Take this.

3515643757
01:13:01.584 --> 01:13:04.000
Thank you.

4025938274
01:13:11.918 --> 01:13:14.250
Goddamn bear.

1702696695
01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:16.667
Eddie, put the rest in the bag.

2936407621
01:13:24.792 --> 01:13:27.083
You got what you wanted?

4288974264
01:13:27.083 --> 01:13:28.667
Let's go.

1964679233
01:13:30.834 --> 01:13:33.918
There's–there's a lot more
out there.

2307255642
01:13:33.918 --> 01:13:37.667
We got to keep looking,
understand?

4143833453
01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:40.876
We're not whole yet.

3772804326
01:13:40.876 --> 01:13:43.375
I'm leaving, Syd.

4159207386
01:13:46.999 --> 01:13:48.626
Go.

3917533012
01:14:11.626 --> 01:14:14.125
Give me the bag.

3978886291
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:17.000
When did you all get so soft?

1169888097
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.751
All got sand in your pussies.

3624479
01:14:22.459 --> 01:14:25.167
Mom! How are we gonna
get out of here?

2734380653
01:14:25.167 --> 01:14:27.334
It's a dead end. What do we do?

4029039141
01:14:27.334 --> 01:14:29.709
Stay away from the bears.

4061424174
01:14:32.042 --> 01:14:33.999
This way.

1867795358
01:14:33.999 --> 01:14:35.876
Come on. There's an opening.

3958117034
01:14:35.876 --> 01:14:37.334
Henry, come here.

701493064
01:14:37.334 --> 01:14:40.751
Dee Dee, get in here.
Someone's coming.

4241782183
01:14:41.751 --> 01:14:44.250
He has a gun.

2308351380
01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:49.876
No!

1867812934
01:14:49.876 --> 01:14:51.792
Come on!

1610787068
01:14:52.042 --> 01:14:53.250
The hell is this?

2450703473
01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:55.834
Whoa. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

3087121444
01:14:55.834 --> 01:14:57.999
–Dad.
–Who are you?

2100416076
01:14:57.999 --> 01:14:59.709
I'm a mom.

1001475318
01:15:00.209 --> 01:15:02.999
Syd, there's kids here.
Let's just go.

3116641506
01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:04.876
No, I'm not leaving
without that cocaine!

1496644062
01:15:04.876 --> 01:15:08.999
So somebody better bring it down
or somebody else is gonna die.

1912934738
01:15:08.999 --> 01:15:11.000
You understand?

2986652126
01:15:12.876 --> 01:15:13.667
Go.

3811387644
01:15:13.667 --> 01:15:16.500
– Come on. Help him out!
– Yeah, yeah.

3150673770
01:15:19.334 --> 01:15:21.959
It's stuck.

868029714
01:15:23.876 --> 01:15:25.751
Who are these guys?

1643849050
01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:28.209
We're going home.

73658722
01:15:28.209 --> 01:15:31.000
W–We're not gonna say anything,
but we're going home.

195553551
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.083
Nobody's going anywhere!

126379912
01:15:33.876 --> 01:15:35.876
–Dad.
–Shut up, Eddie.

1543990360
01:15:35.876 --> 01:15:37.292
–Dad!
–Shut...

1320114210
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:40.792
Get away. Back off. Back off.

3537966016
01:15:40.792 --> 01:15:42.375
Get out of here,
you little

1126069888
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:46.459
Get back! Get...

3999679956
01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:47.792
Stay away.

744533880
01:15:47.792 --> 01:15:48.918
– Whoa.
– Stay away.

2647580116
01:15:48.918 --> 01:15:49.792
Whoa. He hit the bear.

3717064026
01:15:49.792 --> 01:15:51.417
Just give 'em the bag.

2148159938
01:15:51.417 --> 01:15:52.626
Shoot the bears!

3315576763
01:15:52.626 --> 01:15:53.999
–Get over here.
–Whoa!

1438940144
01:15:53.999 --> 01:15:55.417
Hey, can't get a shot.
They're too close to me!

1977765562
01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:57.792
Give them the coke.
They're little cubs.

3845192965
01:15:57.792 --> 01:16:00.375
What's the matter with you?

2176017761
01:16:00.918 --> 01:16:03.626
Shoot the little
cubs, Eddie!

2119845890
01:16:03.626 --> 01:16:04.709
Get 'em off me!

867971250
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:06.500
– Help me out!

2567746189
01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.792
Ow. Eddie!

3001504064
01:16:07.792 --> 01:16:08.876
–Ow!
–No.

3740636892
01:16:09.459 --> 01:16:11.250
Coward. Daveed!

3472217194
01:16:11.626 --> 01:16:13.584
Here, catch.

3981792787
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:19.459
I am taking
the children home.

1713677897
01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:20.876
Mama!

2921563122
01:16:20.876 --> 01:16:23.959
Hell yeah, Mrs. McKinndry.

1002736693
01:16:23.959 --> 01:16:24.667
Look around, Dad.

267959931
01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:26.459
Kids have been dragged
into this.

3865463463
01:16:26.459 --> 01:16:29.250
Get–get out of here,
you little

2060873501
01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:30.751
People are dead.

2042451368
01:16:30.751 --> 01:16:33.125
You are no son of mine.

3568044582
01:16:33.125 --> 01:16:34.209
Hey, you!

2767811224
01:16:34.209 --> 01:16:35.167
You did this.

4215004412
01:16:35.167 --> 01:16:36.500
You're the reason
this is all happening.

1414530661
01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.876
And it's a good thing
he's not like you,

3562413905
01:16:38.876 --> 01:16:41.375
because you're
a piece of crap person

3156312695
01:16:41.375 --> 01:16:43.292
and a bad dad!

1737348122
01:16:43.292 --> 01:16:44.876
Who are you?

2368067659
01:16:44.876 --> 01:16:46.626
I'm Henry,

653193262
01:16:46.626 --> 01:16:49.083
and I am so tired!

3338139336
01:16:49.083 --> 01:16:50.375
Yeah, me, too.

1308946194
01:17:18.626 --> 01:17:20.918
She's protecting the cubs.

2351697347
01:17:21.792 --> 01:17:22.918
–We need to jump.
–Wait, what?

4271028519
01:17:22.918 --> 01:17:24.626
– What? I'll be fine!
– It's gonna be okay.

3415252935
01:17:24.626 --> 01:17:26.000
We're gonna be okay.

181566106
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:26.751
Here, here, here.

1996822296
01:17:26.751 --> 01:17:27.959
Have some coke,
you little.

1987002065
01:17:27.959 --> 01:17:29.500
–Get out of here!
–It's not that far, you guys.

3380370749
01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:32.500
We're gonna be all right.

1732052634
01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.167
– Ready?
– Mm–hmm.

389623867
01:17:34.167 --> 01:17:37.459
Three, two, one. Jump!

3399695157
01:17:53.584 --> 01:17:55.459
Oh. We got to jump.

4070401136
01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:00.751
Let's go!

3175492451
01:18:29.083 --> 01:18:32.834
Come on. It's okay.

489964833
01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:36.209
– Eddie. Help.
– We made it.

819272702
01:19:22.375 --> 01:19:27.250
Get out of here,

3561162212
01:20:01.834 --> 01:20:04.542
He shot you.

1198303322
01:20:04.542 --> 01:20:07.709
Help! Help!

1560511202
01:20:12.167 --> 01:20:14.167
S–Six more days of John.

3822276444
01:20:14.167 --> 01:20:15.876
Okay.

4014545305
01:20:15.876 --> 01:20:16.918
Six more days...

1909394274
01:20:16.918 --> 01:20:19.209
I need you to know,
what I said earlier...

3364573289
01:20:19.209 --> 01:20:21.459
You're more than a drug dealer,
all right?

2044626287
01:20:21.459 --> 01:20:23.417
You're my friend.
You're my best friend.

4164955317
01:20:23.417 --> 01:20:26.500
–All right?
–Mm–hmm. Mm–hmm.

3299190486
01:20:27.042 --> 01:20:29.292
Hey, hey, I...

2616937977
01:20:29.292 --> 01:20:31.542
I got my last question.

4189729948
01:20:31.542 --> 01:20:32.584
What?

1314375763
01:20:32.584 --> 01:20:34.083
It's 20 questions.

1178799384
01:20:34.083 --> 01:20:35.792
I got my last one.

2255467889
01:20:35.792 --> 01:20:39.083
What? All right. Sure.

2767279775
01:20:40.667 --> 01:20:42.709
Is it Joanie?

471162310
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:44.000
It's Joanie, right?

4184775914
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.250
–Yeah.
–Yeah.

3826599531
01:20:46.626 --> 01:20:48.042
How'd you guess?

3723832973
01:20:48.042 --> 01:20:50.751
You're so obvious.

1011921787
01:20:50.751 --> 01:20:52.584
I just didn't want to guess it

682283439
01:20:52.584 --> 01:20:54.751
to have you crying on me
all day.

3410565192
01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:05.626
She's a nurse!

378063582
01:21:05.626 --> 01:21:07.500
He–he got grazed by a bullet.

2538449004
01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:08.834
He's in shock.

1458314511
01:21:08.834 --> 01:21:10.584
Put pressure on him.

2493219579
01:22:05.876 --> 01:22:07.792
I've called backup.

1290063966
01:22:07.792 --> 01:22:11.250
Her name's Rosette.
She doesn't like fetch.

4221875421
01:22:11.417 --> 01:22:13.542
You should get going.

457157249
01:22:13.542 --> 01:22:16.250
Take care of yourself.

1966553134
01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:24.250
Hi. Hi.

152927542
01:22:25.167 --> 01:22:27.167
Rosette.

2909510194
01:22:37.375 --> 01:22:38.876
Whose dog is this?

926681079
01:22:38.876 --> 01:22:40.334
I think it's mine.

2021333667
01:22:40.334 --> 01:22:41.959
Mine and Gabe's.

3430668744
01:22:41.959 --> 01:22:43.500
Is it on cocaine?

408753171
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.709
No.

262818141
01:22:46.459 --> 01:22:49.042
That's a good dog.

3836647495
01:22:50.209 --> 01:22:52.876
So we just grab Gabe
and go, right?

467757247
01:22:52.876 --> 01:22:54.667
Yeah.

2893148243
01:22:57.626 --> 01:22:58.918
I knew you'd be okay.

520811011
01:22:58.918 --> 01:23:01.209
You're the toughest person
I know.

383656960
01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:04.375
I think you get that
from your mom.

282652587
01:23:04.375 --> 01:23:05.626
I think you're right.

1161692481
01:23:05.626 --> 01:23:07.667
Thanks for coming to get me.

3637164557
01:23:07.667 --> 01:23:10.042
I'm your mom. I love you.

285784289
01:23:10.042 --> 01:23:12.083
You, too, Henry.

205651590
01:23:12.083 --> 01:23:14.751
Hey, I'm sorry I pushed Ray
on you too soon.

294018023
01:23:14.751 --> 01:23:18.209
No. You deserve to be happy.

2709268113
01:23:18.584 --> 01:23:19.667
Henry, let's walk over here.

2818032327
01:23:19.667 --> 01:23:22.500
– Stay away from that. Come on.
– I want to look.

3549687291
01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:23.667
I also don't want to look.

2630364108
01:23:23.667 --> 01:23:24.999
– Ugh.
– Don't look.

2551256929
01:23:24.999 --> 01:23:27.626
Let's just cruise on by.

1450004806
01:23:27.626 --> 01:23:30.292
Oh, here come the po–po.

1958826486
01:23:30.292 --> 01:23:31.167
Hey, Mom.

3630559001
01:23:31.167 --> 01:23:33.083
I want to go to Nashville
with you and Ray.

993352486
01:23:33.083 --> 01:23:36.626
Maybe we can go after
me and Henry get out of rehab.

2570207263
01:23:36.626 --> 01:23:37.792
Rehab?

3790106360
01:23:37.792 --> 01:23:39.876
We're cokeheads now.

1245943303
01:23:39.876 --> 01:23:40.417
You know?

2456976430
01:23:40.417 --> 01:23:42.209
We got the bite,
and we're about that life,

1213576993
01:23:42.209 --> 01:23:43.334
– Mrs. McKinndry.
– Mm–hmm.

1826416959
01:23:43.334 --> 01:23:46.751
Yeah, you're
too grounded for rehab.

764591047
01:24:00.876 --> 01:24:02.292
Rodney, are you getting it?

3105998954
01:24:02.292 --> 01:24:04.250
I swear to God, Carol.

2376231723
01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:05.709
Well, then zoom in.

2294600019
01:24:05.709 --> 01:24:08.876
–Is the red light on?
–No, I got it.

4077539808
01:24:09.042 --> 01:24:10.459
Oh, they're so cute.

1128364864
01:24:10.459 --> 01:24:12.042
Oh, this is gonna be good.

1297211317
01:24:12.042 --> 01:24:13.167
Wait.

1007018764
01:24:13.167 --> 01:24:15.000
Why are they looking
at us like that?

3478785858
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.709
Oh.

3370227408
01:24:51.667 --> 01:24:53.667
Hey.

3767657613
01:24:53.667 --> 01:24:56.542
Oh, hold up. Hold up. Hey.

3902476185
01:25:38.167 --> 01:25:40.876
Daddy!

2111571716
01:25:44.292 --> 01:25:47.125
– Is that for me?
– Hey.

1963275862
01:25:47.125 --> 01:25:48.918
Yeah, what do you think?

3795802083
01:25:51.792 --> 01:25:52.626
What's it eating?

2744751795
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:57.709
Oh, my God.

3092924141
01:25:57.709 --> 01:26:00.125
They're weren't gonna
put 'em back on.
