("SUMMER HOLIDAY"
BY CLIFF RICHARD AND THE SHADOWS)

758997864
00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:56.125
Sorry, darling. Go on, carry on.

3137437942
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.417
So in 1824,

3457738133
00:01:58.542 --> 00:02:03.417
the whole island quarantined itself
in fear of a deadly flu pandemic.

1602293718
00:02:03.542 --> 00:02:05.667
Does it say
how long the quarantine lasted?

3929484301
00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.959
Yeah. What began as three months

1658994629
00:02:08.042 --> 00:02:11.667
eventually lasted almost
two and a half years!

1425461384
00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:15.709
- Wow. What suffering. Amazing.
- Totally amazing.

2875593834
00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:18.292
Long after the mainland
had ended the quarantine,

3089273027
00:02:18.417 --> 00:02:20.542
it remained in place on the island

2781073265
00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:25.000
until most people had either died, aw,
or had turned to cannibalism

720921745
00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:28.000
to feed themselves and their children.

1927144472
00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:30.792
- How many people died?
- Oh, it doesn't actually say.

4034762083
00:02:30.918 --> 00:02:33.751
- I need a death toll.
- Hey, language.

4041401849
00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:37.999
- Does it matter how many people died?
- Actually, I agree with Sam on this.

968247577
00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:39.876
It would be nice
to have an exact figure.

3770579158
00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.959
Yeah, I think I'd give more
if it was 200 people,

3129255642
00:02:43.042 --> 00:02:44.584
- rather than, say...
- Four?

955879436
00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:45.667
Yeah, four.

3871112414
00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:47.209
- Yeah.
- Four people.

2765258995
00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.792
OK, well, I heard it was hundreds.
Are you happy?

2356893261
00:02:49.918 --> 00:02:51.334
Very. Thank you.

2682461937
00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.417
Every ten years, the islanders
celebrate the festival of...

603133462
00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:58.792
- Karant n!
- Or quarantine.

3155755367
00:02:58.918 --> 00:03:01.375
- A gory eight-hour play...
- Eight hours!

3729674955
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.167
- Hey, hey!
- Sorry, Dad.

4246480117
00:03:04.292 --> 00:03:06.334
I hate the theatre.

20907326
00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.000
- Mummy, thank you for the info.
- You're welcome, Daddy.

4266914710
00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:10.667
Gross.

2569438971
00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:13.083
- I would never eat a person.
- Why not?

3845683774
00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.918
- I'm a vegetarian.
- Oh, here we go.

1184197655
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.709
- That's right.
- Don't belittle my beliefs.

1962190655
00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:19.292
Beliefs!

2467645880
00:03:19.417 --> 00:03:20.918
I'm sorry, but believe me,

4137317684
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.959
if you were hungry enough,
you'd eat a man.

1660992371
00:03:23.042 --> 00:03:24.292
Or a woman.

1970618844
00:03:24.417 --> 00:03:26.125
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Don't forget about us!

505692369
00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:00.667
Sorry, hello.

3829613610
00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:02.667
Sorry to interrupt.

1422972653
00:04:03.417 --> 00:04:04.918
Could we order some food, please?

1513249103
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.918
Could I have two hamburgares, please?

521362079
00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.959
And then two pomme frites.
Chips, fries, chips.

1499630352
00:04:25.042 --> 00:04:27.876
And then two very large beers, please.

44513866
00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:31.792
- And, um, kids, what do you want?
- Uh, yeah, uh...

2126413723
00:04:31.918 --> 00:04:34.959
- Hi. Sorry, do you have a veggie burger?
- Oh, God.

1946752565
00:04:35.042 --> 00:04:37.876
- A bun with no beef?
- Yeah.

3765929550
00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:48.999
We have burgers
made from land meat or sea meat.

3259239768
00:04:49.083 --> 00:04:53.709
- Perfect. Uh, what's the sea meat?
- Fermented mackerel anus.

1483390729
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.167
What, um...?

4019953965
00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:59.209
- Just chips, thanks.
- Chips.

1802865604
00:04:59.334 --> 00:05:03.042
Yes, uh... thank you. And, Jessie,
what are you having, honey?

3664527351
00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:04.792
- Nothing. I'm not hungry.
- Oh, my God!

3641127567
00:05:04.918 --> 00:05:07.042
- You have to eat something.
- I'll eat later.

2705505808
00:05:07.167 --> 00:05:09.209
- Do you promise me you'll eat later?
- No.

259118541
00:05:09.334 --> 00:05:11.167
Jessie, where are you...?
Oh, my God.

2039749966
00:05:11.292 --> 00:05:15.292
Oh, sorry, could I also, could I get
some cheese on my burger, please?

2275747202
00:05:15.417 --> 00:05:16.751
Nej.

3806848644
00:05:17.542 --> 00:05:19.334
No, OK. Why not?

4225780756
00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:21.250
- Where are you going?
- To find Jessie.

3253341340
00:05:23.042 --> 00:05:24.999
Jeez! Sorry.

1882674427
00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:29.375
And sorry about my kids.
They're an absolute nightmare today.

358469582
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.209
I think they're bored.

2333261859
00:05:32.334 --> 00:05:34.167
Do you have children yourself?

3227939441
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.792
Nej. It died.

1087616850
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.709
Well, of course it did.

2089343824
00:05:44.542 --> 00:05:45.667
Oh!

2483783953
00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:46.918
- Hiya!
- Hello, darling.

3858138307
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.959
- Here you go.
- Oh, tack.

3426915676
00:05:49.042 --> 00:05:50.667
Does that taste like fish? Oh!

3848191723
00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:54.999
Sorry. Thank God we have the table number
so we don't get confused with anyone else.

3412833274
00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:58.000
- There's no one in here.
- Will you go shout for the kids?

2122869666
00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:01.125
- Where are they?
- Oh, my God, Richard, I don't know.

1783718179
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.834
Use your brain.

3446932325
00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:07.250
- All right, sorry.
- Where are they?

2111001164
00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:08.500
Do I look like a psychic?

1298832741
00:06:10.375 --> 00:06:14.167
- What do you think happened?
- Dunno.

1241871194
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.999
Kids, food!

1857630171
00:06:20.083 --> 00:06:21.375
We should go.

223109958
00:06:22.918 --> 00:06:24.292
I'm starving.

3737923470
00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:30.999
- Ugh. Gross.
- Yeah, ew.

4096788135
00:06:36.042 --> 00:06:37.834
- That was pretty good.
- I don't know.

451316906
00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:39.375
- My tummy's like fish.
- Hello.

2421826036
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.334
- Through?
- It was lovely, thank you very much.

4137526283
00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:44.375
Let me ask,
can we buy tickets here for the ferry?

2333616358
00:06:45.042 --> 00:06:46.500
Do I look like the ferry?

3534071181
00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:48.959
- No.
- No, I just thought I'd ask. Sorry.

440544694
00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:51.334
- Where are you going?
- Oh, we're going to Sv lta.

3727238673
00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:00.876
You cannot go there.
It is f"rbjudet during Karant n.

1158701511
00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:04.209
- I don't think it is, is it?
- This is Europe, yeah?

1927534247
00:07:04.334 --> 00:07:06.542
There are no hotels on the island.

3453145162
00:07:06.667 --> 00:07:08.375
This is the last ferry.
You'll be stranded.

2856866199
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.125
No, we won't be stranded
because we're staying on the island.

2658707196
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.667
- We've actually booked a B&amp;B.
- Hang on. Here. Have a look.

3613207598
00:07:14.792 --> 00:07:16.417
- Richard.
- Shush.

1034317687
00:07:16.542 --> 00:07:21.042
- That's the house of Matts Larsson.
- Yes, it is.

3683424961
00:07:21.167 --> 00:07:22.834
It doesn't get
more Swedish than that, does it?

2267868388
00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:24.209
Yes, it does.

4068426166
00:07:25.667 --> 00:07:28.209
Why did you show him the app?

4112488859
00:07:28.334 --> 00:07:30.500
- He just seemed nice.
- But he's not the B&amp;B police.

1280974019
00:07:30.626 --> 00:07:33.125
I know he isn't. Sorry.

116677413
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.250
You don't have
to apologise for everything.

318764735
00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:37.209
- Maybe...
- It makes me the bad one.

761375038
00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:39.542
I promise you.

3393860195
00:07:40.542 --> 00:07:42.876
You will not be welcome on the island.

1012341532
00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:45.042
They don't like visitors
at the best of times.

639848993
00:07:45.167 --> 00:07:46.500
Oh. Why?

1387042081
00:07:47.876 --> 00:07:50.584
Foreigners on the island
during Karant n play?

716450260
00:07:51.417 --> 00:07:53.709
It is like serving pork chops
at a bar mitzvah.

961994027
00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:57.500
- Would anyone do that?
- Yeah.

3160918578
00:07:57.626 --> 00:07:59.834
- I don't know.
- What's his problem?

4154082477
00:08:00.292 --> 00:08:01.709
Maybe he doesn't like vegetarians.

1411368369
00:08:01.834 --> 00:08:03.999
I'm sure there are vegetarians
in Sweden.

3511551933
00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:06.209
Stockholm, yeah, sure.

327141160
00:08:06.334 --> 00:08:08.000
Malm", Gothenburg, at a push.

1846904561
00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:11.792
I think it's awful that anyone would
hold on to a grudge for 200 years.

1837156582
00:08:11.918 --> 00:08:14.167
Says the Irish lady.

835323890
00:08:14.292 --> 00:08:15.667
- The ferry!
- Oh, good. The ferry.

1570176910
00:08:15.792 --> 00:08:17.125
Yes! Come on!

3673840302
00:08:22.918 --> 00:08:26.334
- Hey! I'm sorry to interrupt you.
- What?

2137699041
00:08:26.459 --> 00:08:29.542
- Can I pay?
- I don't know. Can you?

3072489232
00:08:29.667 --> 00:08:31.834
Come on, I'm in a bit of a rush.

441787740
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.167
- Please, I'm going to miss the ferry.
- Perhaps that's for the best.

4243189800
00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:40.375
What do I owe you?

4251882064
00:08:42.876 --> 00:08:44.375
Uh...

4083723957
00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:48.667
Three hundred crowns.

1905662609
00:08:50.584 --> 00:08:52.459
Right. Um...

1037392478
00:08:53.167 --> 00:08:57.125
I can't... My hands are so sweaty.

1299743553
00:08:58.751 --> 00:09:00.709
Ah!

4150044181
00:09:00.834 --> 00:09:04.083
- Right, yes.
- Cash only.

746267012
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.918
OK. Uh...

1638468790
00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:11.500
One. Are they ones? Yes. Two.

3969922745
00:09:13.584 --> 00:09:14.999
What are you doing? You're hurting me.

1827033751
00:09:15.083 --> 00:09:17.292
If you know what's best for you,
don't get on that ferry.

875156733
00:09:18.042 --> 00:09:22.375
Take your nice family and get back
into your hired car.

2600659036
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.334
I said you're hurting me!

1133907874
00:09:24.459 --> 00:09:27.542
- I have to leave.
- Don't say I didn't warn you.

1797760174
00:09:36.834 --> 00:09:39.125
What's wrong? Richard?

55470182
00:09:40.542 --> 00:09:42.626
- I know that look. What's wrong?
- I'm fine.

2731833334
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:43.918
Richard!

40080751
00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:46.334
- Yes?
- Oh, hello.

3699860505
00:09:46.459 --> 00:09:48.167
Could we order four tickets, please?

1159187104
00:09:49.584 --> 00:09:51.542
Four tickets? To where?

1160015158
00:09:52.375 --> 00:09:56.125
Uh, well, we're going
where you're going, silly.

1554920231
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.083
- Sv lta.
- CAPTAIN: Let's go!

3855822984
00:09:58.209 --> 00:09:59.959
Well, this is most unusual.

3529519113
00:10:00.459 --> 00:10:01.751
Come on, Dad.

1644627070
00:10:01.876 --> 00:10:03.375
- Sorry.
- What's wrong?

720430999
00:10:06.667 --> 00:10:08.459
- I've left my blooming wallet inside.
- D'oh!

462956085
00:10:08.584 --> 00:10:09.918
- Shut up, Sam.
- Sam.

3259459050
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.542
Well, then, you numpty, just go.
Run, run, run, quick, quick.

856893219
00:10:12.667 --> 00:10:13.876
- Go, go!
- Yes.

1819771940
00:10:13.999 --> 00:10:15.209
- Go, Richard. Run.
- I'm going.

164753029
00:10:15.334 --> 00:10:18.876
We must leave now.
To be late is f"rbjudet.

516612948
00:10:18.999 --> 00:10:22.667
- After this boat, no more.
- Oh, when's the next ferry?

717981563
00:10:22.792 --> 00:10:27.334
- In three days, after Karant n is over.
- So, yeah, four return tickets, please.

4143899820
00:10:28.667 --> 00:10:30.167
I take your names, please.

3244855241
00:10:30.626 --> 00:10:33.751
- Why do you need our names?
- For our passenger manifest.

3613743635
00:10:33.876 --> 00:10:36.250
In case we sink, and everyone drowns.

1326300429
00:10:36.792 --> 00:10:39.834
Oh, lovely, of course.
Um, well, we're the Smiths.

3348464411
00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:42.792
I'm Susan. And this is Sam.

1805278366
00:10:42.918 --> 00:10:45.792
- Just Sam.
- And then this is Jessie.

845543217
00:10:45.918 --> 00:10:47.667
And then my husband is...

2247399656
00:10:47.792 --> 00:10:50.751
- Come on, Daddy!
- Hey!

4240985586
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:55.792
And this is Richard, my husband.
Daddy, come on, the tide.

382811968
00:10:58.751 --> 00:11:00.125
- All OK?
- Yeah, fine.

1423551657
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.042
- Yeah?
- Yes.

2466973484
00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:03.792
Oh! You've got some ketchup on your top.

3949446193
00:11:03.918 --> 00:11:04.918
- Have I?
- Silly.

1050949166
00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:07.959
Oh, yes. Ah! Here we are.

1919651229
00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:10.500
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

4172512865
00:11:10.626 --> 00:11:12.000
Right, let's go!

2318649877
00:11:12.709 --> 00:11:16.334
Come on. All aboard the Skylark!

2790688049
00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:18.375
- He's so embarrassing.
- We're adopted, right?

3322794040
00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:37.999
- What's happening?
- I don't know, Richard, I don't know.

3287309043
00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:44.918
It's Johan the Dane.

884136477
00:11:45.709 --> 00:11:49.334
- You want to make drink with me?
- Um...

3413792666
00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.918
That's a nice offer.
We're actually not big drinkers, are we?

2362125803
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.334
- No.
- I wasn't talking to you.

3348526303
00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:08.834
- Shall we?
- We could have a look around the boat.

1196406624
00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:10.209
Oh, let's.

3276913928
00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:14.918
( "SOMMAR SOMMAR SOMMAR"
BY ALICE BABS)

2905500867
00:12:45.918 --> 00:12:46.876
Uh...

709850696
00:12:50.125 --> 00:12:51.959
Well, well, well.

2155863188
00:12:52.709 --> 00:12:56.500
- Thank you. You honour us!
- No, Richard, don't.

1551999537
00:13:05.209 --> 00:13:08.000
- What?
- Who are you?

2099291785
00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:11.918
- Why have you come here today?
- Why are you here?

929262521
00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:14.083
It's our holiday.

1804090587
00:13:15.083 --> 00:13:16.918
Holidagen?

2009482561
00:13:18.042 --> 00:13:20.125
Yes, but not just holidagen.

118341205
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:24.375
We're also here
to see your wonderful play.

2308632568
00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:32.626
Play? How dare you?

1473138775
00:13:33.876 --> 00:13:38.167
Billy Elliot is a play.
Grease the Musical is a play.

1356381917
00:13:39.083 --> 00:13:43.292
This is Karant n. This is our life.

4241402495
00:13:44.209 --> 00:13:46.542
No play.

802575822
00:13:46.667 --> 00:13:49.542
Sorry,
I think we've got off on the wrong foot.

25351292
00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:52.459
The commune has made a judgement.

1840963567
00:13:52.584 --> 00:13:55.918
You must get back on the ferry
and return to the mainland.

1523941844
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.918
You are not welcome here.

4092587638
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.417
- Right, but...
- Yeah. Sorry for the pushback. Um...

1575754091
00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:05.334
We didn't think this was...
It's not a private island, is it?

1727259647
00:14:05.459 --> 00:14:11.083
Yeah, all we want to do is
just see your... the thing, show,

85395098
00:14:11.209 --> 00:14:13.459
and just pay our respects to the dead.

1753290935
00:14:14.083 --> 00:14:17.000
The dead? What do you know of the dead?

920145102
00:14:17.125 --> 00:14:19.167
- Oh, well. Quite a lot, actually.
- Mum, don't.

956039124
00:14:19.292 --> 00:14:22.292
No, they'll find it interesting.
They will find it interesting.

1736295973
00:14:22.417 --> 00:14:27.709
My great-great-great-great-
great-grandfather actually died

4283069956
00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:30.042
here on this island, on Sv lta, so...

3247753280
00:14:31.167 --> 00:14:33.709
Who was your ancestor?

1260015296
00:14:33.834 --> 00:14:39.375
He was the...
well, one of the brave officers

2943035612
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.459
who your ancestors murdered.

3375807249
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.209
You will leave this place
one way or another.

2312282512
00:14:51.542 --> 00:14:54.334
Sue! Mummy, are you...?

1073367702
00:14:54.459 --> 00:14:56.167
She licked my face, she licked my face!

58804572
00:14:56.292 --> 00:14:58.500
Oh, hey!

2830292846
00:14:58.626 --> 00:15:00.542
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!

1601678368
00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:02.584
I see you have already met
our friendly commune.

1238263806
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.626
- Welcome to Sv lta.
- Thank you.

1319248830
00:15:06.751 --> 00:15:09.000
I'm... I'm Matts.

890486719
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.751
They are mostly harmless.

4274205805
00:15:14.375 --> 00:15:15.542
Mostly.

2767969530
00:15:15.667 --> 00:15:18.334
- Well, they don't seem harmless.
- Yeah.

304776079
00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:21.918
Matts Larsson. You know these outsiders?

2319290787
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.209
Huh.

1787099150
00:15:23.667 --> 00:15:26.876
Yes. I have rented them
my mother's house.

3204882091
00:15:26.999 --> 00:15:29.459
You did not seek agreement
from the commune.

2848988867
00:15:29.584 --> 00:15:30.792
This is not your island.

840577913
00:15:30.918 --> 00:15:34.918
It is not any of your business
who I rent my mother's house to.

1918872832
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.542
Yes, it's Sweden, 2024.

699992053
00:15:40.125 --> 00:15:42.918
The rules of our society
on this matter are clear.

609706521
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.918
The rules remain in place
to protect us from people like this.

3857801656
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.626
Two hundred years ago.

910951020
00:15:48.751 --> 00:15:50.751
Your poor mother would turn in her grave

2699452262
00:15:50.876 --> 00:15:53.999
if she could see
what kind of a man you have become.

2186149580
00:15:54.083 --> 00:15:56.792
I hope you'll be able to tell her about it

3187184180
00:15:57.959 --> 00:16:00.125
in person one day soon.

3212998103
00:16:02.626 --> 00:16:05.500
Do enjoy your time on Sv lta.

4096455018
00:16:05.626 --> 00:16:07.542
It will be short.

2263005096
00:16:13.792 --> 00:16:16.167
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

1986858790
00:16:16.292 --> 00:16:19.292
Oh, God, honestly, I give up, I give up.

415726380
00:16:22.876 --> 00:16:27.584
OK, come on. Put your bags on the cart.
We will go now to your house.

3647814934
00:16:27.709 --> 00:16:30.042
It's fine.
We'll push it ourselves, thank you.

1349234906
00:16:30.667 --> 00:16:32.500
That's your decision.

2718000431
00:16:32.626 --> 00:16:34.709
Kids, wait a second.

1466405377
00:16:34.834 --> 00:16:37.125
Hey, you OK?

4261689055
00:16:38.334 --> 00:16:41.792
If you're having second thoughts, you
should probably say something right now.

2611102429
00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:43.709
No, I need this holiday, Richard.

2726242312
00:16:44.584 --> 00:16:46.000
I need it.

2804878857
00:16:47.709 --> 00:16:48.876
It'll be good. We'll be fine.

3660024094
00:16:48.999 --> 00:16:50.417
- OK.
- Yeah.

701047915
00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:51.626
- Good.
- Yeah.

4217057283
00:16:51.751 --> 00:16:54.459
Oh.

4202411992
00:16:55.751 --> 00:16:57.959
- Oh, shoes off, please.
-  Oh, of course.

1706761051
00:16:58.042 --> 00:17:00.959
You'll find a pair of slippers here
for each of you.

1537363690
00:17:01.042 --> 00:17:04.459
Do I have to?
I'd rather keep my trainers on.

1516880836
00:17:04.584 --> 00:17:07.209
It is the tradition in Sweden,
so if you can.

3746055844
00:17:08.834 --> 00:17:11.876
- Well, it's our tradition...
- Feels comfy womfy? No?

1449657131
00:17:12.584 --> 00:17:13.709
- Yeah.
- All right.

4053907370
00:17:13.834 --> 00:17:15.334
Comfy womfy.

4078974257
00:17:15.459 --> 00:17:17.417
I don't understand
why I have to take my trainers off.

322061856
00:17:17.542 --> 00:17:20.709
It's our tradition here in Skne, so...

4136627014
00:17:20.834 --> 00:17:24.417
- Feels comfy too?
- Stop saying that. My trainers are comfy.

2874043982
00:17:24.542 --> 00:17:26.918
Just put them on.

2936342363
00:17:27.334 --> 00:17:31.751
Well, well, well.
This is lovely. It's very Swedish.

2841488836
00:17:32.542 --> 00:17:34.876
That's because we are in Sweden.

2018622221
00:17:35.375 --> 00:17:37.751
- Yeah. Of course we are.
- Cos we're there.

1540861027
00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:42.500
And you were saying
this was your mother's house, Matts?

1616244573
00:17:42.626 --> 00:17:44.250
Yeah, she was born here,

3634837677
00:17:44.375 --> 00:17:49.792
and, uh, in 1974, she married my father,
right here on the island.

4160648531
00:17:49.918 --> 00:17:52.417
- That is so sweet.
- Hmm.

2129625485
00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:56.042
Yeah, no, no, no,
it was February, minus 25.

764569533
00:17:56.167 --> 00:17:58.042
Very bad snow.

2068371038
00:17:58.167 --> 00:18:00.542
My mother and her sisters
arrived at the ferry

3091996710
00:18:00.667 --> 00:18:03.751
only to find the sea outside
the harbour wall had frozen solid, so...

375009853
00:18:03.876 --> 00:18:05.500
Oh, what happened?

1693863247
00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:08.918
Well, in their high heels and...

509362930
00:18:10.626 --> 00:18:13.250
big coats, they walked across the ice.

3944752819
00:18:13.375 --> 00:18:14.459
My father and...

2277539011
00:18:17.751 --> 00:18:23.626
his brothers met them in the harbour,
and the wedding went ahead.

1759307534
00:18:24.709 --> 00:18:26.542
- That is so romantic.
- Yeah.

1850514199
00:18:28.834 --> 00:18:30.918
And is she still with us, Matts?

1046405074
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Sadly, no.
She died ten years ago, aged 91.

905905108
00:18:35.125 --> 00:18:36.167
- Wow.
- God.

4176884560
00:18:36.292 --> 00:18:37.375
I'm sorry.

273556689
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.417
- But she had a lovely long life.
- Yes.

794597268
00:18:39.542 --> 00:18:44.042
And then she was murdered, beheaded,
right there in her favourite chair.

1085098621
00:18:44.167 --> 00:18:46.334
- Oh!
-Jesus.

1870695915
00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:48.167
- Oh.
-  Um...

1716663468
00:18:48.292 --> 00:18:51.167
- Sorry.
- Richard, get up out of that chair.

3496649484
00:18:51.626 --> 00:18:54.083
Can we, um, go upstairs
and check out our rooms?

100832160
00:18:54.918 --> 00:18:57.375
Yeah, of course, of course.
This is your house now.

2536357716
00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.459
Hm-hmm.

2260410934
00:18:58.584 --> 00:19:00.000
- Oh, thank you.
- Good.

3814659660
00:19:00.125 --> 00:19:01.667
Get up
out of the chair, Richard.

3235161014
00:19:01.792 --> 00:19:05.083
- Let me take you. Here we go.
- It's better like that.

1114879146
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.959
I want this one.

2912372816
00:19:12.042 --> 00:19:15.334
Ah!

1676794659
00:19:15.459 --> 00:19:18.999
Jesus!

980742859
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.751
My phone's got no signal, Sam.

2978757379
00:19:26.876 --> 00:19:30.500
Of course it hasn't! We've come
on holiday to a Swedish horror film.

1147859149
00:19:38.584 --> 00:19:39.709
Hey.

3478677503
00:19:40.459 --> 00:19:43.959
Don't be scared. It's only Matts.

3388595523
00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:47.792
I'm not scared.
I just, uh, didn't hear you come up.

4245924227
00:19:47.918 --> 00:19:51.417
Oh, I'm almost silent in my slippers.

1460786683
00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:55.125
Maybe you should wear
a little bell round your neck.

1797709659
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.417
- Oh, like a young cat.
- Yeah.

3668093183
00:19:59.542 --> 00:20:04.000
And that way, you can let the
little birdies know when you're coming.

4217183400
00:20:04.125 --> 00:20:06.250
Now why would I want to do that?

1910229898
00:20:11.125 --> 00:20:12.751
Meow!

1509556607
00:20:17.584 --> 00:20:20.000
Meow!

3888176731
00:20:22.709 --> 00:20:26.417
Meow!

829988834
00:20:30.959 --> 00:20:33.417
I must go and leave you
to begin your vacation.

2471118370
00:20:33.542 --> 00:20:34.542
Oh, Matts, before you go,

79519031
00:20:34.667 --> 00:20:36.751
did you manage to get
those bits of shopping I asked for?

2388213363
00:20:36.876 --> 00:20:37.999
Oh, yeah, I did.

858886076
00:20:38.083 --> 00:20:41.542
I put 'em all away
into the cupboards and the fridge.

880698618
00:20:49.542 --> 00:20:51.250
Well, we better get on.

3954657399
00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:53.417
This chicken paprika
isn't going to make itself.

2002523240
00:20:53.542 --> 00:20:56.751
- Yeah. Oh, I couldn't get paprika.
- Oh, not to worry.

3962476893
00:20:59.167 --> 00:21:00.709
Or chicken.

1777186861
00:21:05.876 --> 00:21:08.083
- Well, toasties it is then, Daddy.
- Delicious.

2400569236
00:21:25.626 --> 00:21:28.500
Wow! These are razor sharp.

1170691402
00:21:28.626 --> 00:21:30.209
Be careful, Daddy.

4277637886
00:21:30.751 --> 00:21:33.459
Life must've been before phones.

2418956973
00:21:33.584 --> 00:21:36.709
No wonder they had
massive wars, right?

1470898065
00:21:36.834 --> 00:21:39.709
So bored all the time.
Nothing better to do.

2478681453
00:21:41.375 --> 00:21:44.250
- Have I got time for a bath?
- Course you do, darling.

2362330632
00:21:44.375 --> 00:21:46.959
You're on your holibobs!

2502695874
00:21:47.667 --> 00:21:49.834
Go have a nice soak
and forget about your phone.

1220063783
00:21:51.125 --> 00:21:53.584
Ow! Don't touch me.
Don't touch me!

1517856886
00:21:53.709 --> 00:21:55.751
- Mum, can you tell her?
- Yeah, don't touch him.

554230895
00:21:55.876 --> 00:21:56.876
Not...

3499141831
00:21:58.083 --> 00:21:59.709
Jessie, don't...

2524476034
00:23:53.417 --> 00:23:55.626
- What's going on?
- Well, I don't know, do I?

1724211278
00:23:55.792 --> 00:23:59.000
- How am I supposed to know?
- I don't understand. What do we do?

2123149292
00:23:59.125 --> 00:24:00.959
- I'm going down there.
- Don't be stupid.

3583054916
00:24:01.042 --> 00:24:02.167
I am, I'm going down there.

1092564248
00:24:02.292 --> 00:24:06.918
Baby, I am not going to be scared away
by these people, whatever they are.

1745648539
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.584
We have every right to be here, Richard.

1898448650
00:24:08.709 --> 00:24:11.834
We do, but Brexit! Sue...

3530851580
00:24:12.792 --> 00:24:14.209
Susan.

1579001691
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:29.667
Leave us alone!

141752721
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.459
There are children inside sleeping.

1983922936
00:24:36.584 --> 00:24:39.459
And you're frightening us.
So please, just...

2536678642
00:24:40.584 --> 00:24:41.709
go away!

4034847732
00:24:55.918 --> 00:24:58.250
- Richard!
- What are you doing?

447528646
00:24:59.292 --> 00:25:00.459
You can't leave that here!

819868515
00:25:09.417 --> 00:25:12.250
- Well, thanks for your help, Richard.
- I thought I'd let you helm this one.

2095982286
00:25:12.375 --> 00:25:14.584
- Oh, cheers.
- Are you cross?

1940558225
00:25:14.709 --> 00:25:16.542
We talked about this
in couple's counselling.

3262797647
00:25:16.667 --> 00:25:19.292
It's really important that, as a man,

55732951
00:25:19.417 --> 00:25:22.751
sometimes I sit back and empower you,
and you did great.

2653073899
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.292
- Shut up, Richard!
- Sorry.

2351092177
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.209
I'm going back to bed.

3896903956
00:25:29.334 --> 00:25:31.500
- You can deal with this.
- What do you want me to do with it?

2369513700
00:25:31.626 --> 00:25:32.792
Work it out!

3909491482
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Do... Do we have bin bags?

4278284924
00:25:57.292 --> 00:26:01.042
- Hey, morning! You all right?
- Uh, no, not really.

1720802047
00:26:02.125 --> 00:26:05.042
OK. Um... something I can help with?

3790969543
00:26:05.876 --> 00:26:09.125
- Probably not.
- Is this about last night?

1476521721
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:12.584
- No, what happened last night?
- Forget it.

593323116
00:26:12.709 --> 00:26:16.834
What's on your mind? Cos you know
you can talk to me about anything.

1402291293
00:26:16.959 --> 00:26:18.375
I won't be shocked, I promise.

3045142438
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:24.500
Between us, when I was a younger man,
I used to live in Vienna, and, uh...

1426138993
00:26:26.083 --> 00:26:30.500
Between us, I used to do a bit
of the old cannabis.

727601308
00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.459
Ah!

1368289325
00:26:38.167 --> 00:26:42.584
I feel like we are being watched.

2240270578
00:26:43.083 --> 00:26:47.125
- What makes you say that?
- So last night, I was taking a soak,

1492533389
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:51.834
and I could hear noises
coming from behind that big mirror.

3152439822
00:26:51.959 --> 00:26:53.999
Right. What kind of noises?

2259228634
00:26:54.334 --> 00:26:57.667
I don't know,
like a shuffling, a loud crack.

2003067203
00:26:57.792 --> 00:26:59.876
All right, well,
it could have been us moving around.

2785904410
00:26:59.999 --> 00:27:02.209
- It's a very old house.
- No. It wasn't that.

36780923
00:27:03.292 --> 00:27:05.999
Cos it was
actually quite creepy, and, um...

2872167250
00:27:06.083 --> 00:27:08.250
- Shh. Come here, come here.
- I'm sorry, I just...

4069603068
00:27:08.375 --> 00:27:10.334
It's all right. It's OK.

1878788552
00:27:10.459 --> 00:27:13.626
If you ever hear anything else again,
just come and wake me up, all right?

1429579728
00:27:13.751 --> 00:27:14.959
- Yeah, OK.
- You promise?

3742030388
00:27:15.042 --> 00:27:17.167
Sorry. Oh, God. I'm just being silly,
I feel like...

1280349703
00:27:19.542 --> 00:27:22.876
Joking aside,
what I said before about cannabis...

1337628091
00:27:22.999 --> 00:27:23.999
Right.

109266816
00:27:24.083 --> 00:27:27.083
Don't do it, because in the end, for me,

3098134360
00:27:28.834 --> 00:27:30.876
I went a bit mad,

3525286303
00:27:30.999 --> 00:27:32.334
and it wasn't nice.

1936175261
00:27:32.459 --> 00:27:35.959
Well, no, I tried cannabis once,
and, um...

1628164148
00:27:36.042 --> 00:27:37.709
Not my thing, it wasn't for me.
I hated it.

2768605099
00:27:37.834 --> 00:27:40.125
- Good.
- So, yeah. Cool?

1724695090
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:41.834
- Cool.
- Cool.

1272529036
00:27:44.417 --> 00:27:45.667
What is your thing?

1882262269
00:27:46.292 --> 00:27:48.834
Cocaine and fat.

103146634
00:27:48.959 --> 00:27:49.918
Charming.

1404460174
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.500
- Hey!
- Oh, hey.

2924817359
00:28:14.626 --> 00:28:15.751
Can I come in?

3784910621
00:28:18.876 --> 00:28:19.959
Uh, hey...

3825353333
00:28:22.375 --> 00:28:24.500
This is a bit awkward, um...

2560611886
00:28:24.626 --> 00:28:27.542
You didn't happen to see all the people
outside here last night, did you?

432979741
00:28:28.709 --> 00:28:30.709
No. What were they doing?

4187725404
00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:36.167
Um... It's hard to say.
They were... humming.

266772051
00:28:36.709 --> 00:28:38.792
- It was really threatening, you know?
- Hmm.

2280427766
00:28:39.292 --> 00:28:41.667
Look. They threw this at us.

2811167451
00:28:45.083 --> 00:28:47.125
- Oh.
- Do you know what it is?

3411368319
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.417
It's dead.

1520713569
00:28:51.083 --> 00:28:53.167
Yeah, I know it's dead, but...

542177297
00:28:53.999 --> 00:28:55.918
it also feels
a bit like a warning, you know?

1941101354
00:28:56.417 --> 00:28:58.500
Yeah, maybe. Maybe not.

1612618045
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.167
It could also be this kind of traditional
welcome here in Skne, so...

1526874623
00:29:04.292 --> 00:29:05.542
Ah, right.

2775283020
00:29:08.999 --> 00:29:11.459
Is it a traditional welcome
here in Skne?

592489424
00:29:11.792 --> 00:29:14.083
No. It is a warning.

2692796949
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.626
Ever since we came to Sv lta,
we have felt nothing but unwelcome,

107096078
00:29:19.751 --> 00:29:25.500
and it's a shame, you know, because
the app, it promised so much more.

2152721920
00:29:26.167 --> 00:29:31.959
And ju... between us, I'm not, I'm not
a confrontational person at all, but...

390138200
00:29:33.042 --> 00:29:35.959
our review is going
to be less than favourable.

117118279
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.334
I will take this to the commune.

1356794928
00:29:43.542 --> 00:29:46.042
Thank you. I appreciate that. It's, uh...

3947385630
00:29:47.792 --> 00:29:50.417
It's been a hell of a year.
We need this, you know?

67767247
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:54.709
OK. Thank you.

1367403130
00:29:54.834 --> 00:29:55.709
- Yeah.
- Bye-bye.

258736861
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.042
Oh, God, I needed this.

323584382
00:30:06.083 --> 00:30:07.459
Hang on.

3381114211
00:30:08.417 --> 00:30:10.584
Here we go. Hang on, no. That's video.

2426465379
00:30:11.709 --> 00:30:12.959
Portrait.

1296660578
00:30:13.042 --> 00:30:15.167
-  What are you doing?
- Hang on, let me do it that way.

999789600
00:30:15.292 --> 00:30:16.959
Oh, give it to me.

1784731746
00:30:19.542 --> 00:30:20.667
I love you, Mummy.

2691460221
00:30:20.792 --> 00:30:22.999
Oh, love you, Daddy.
Can't wait till the big day.

2990080743
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.626
Huh. Beautiful!

3636345675
00:30:41.125 --> 00:30:43.792
OK. Nice.

459533232
00:30:43.918 --> 00:30:45.959
Tack.

3379267313
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:06.876
Duck, Richard! Stay still.

3515685349
00:31:06.999 --> 00:31:09.584
- Susan! What do I do?
- Just...

2733962935
00:31:09.709 --> 00:31:11.792
Oh! You've got to stay still, Richard!

3986525497
00:31:11.918 --> 00:31:14.334
- Stop laughing! Stop it!
- It thinks you're one of its eggs!

2003049697
00:31:14.459 --> 00:31:15.584
What does it want?

1727927731
00:31:15.709 --> 00:31:17.209
- He thinks you're an egg!
- I'm not an egg!

4222165587
00:31:17.334 --> 00:31:18.209
- You are!
- Stop it!

2532674715
00:31:22.834 --> 00:31:24.209
Look, there's a boat.

1324279408
00:31:26.834 --> 00:31:28.042
Oh...

308796796
00:31:29.209 --> 00:31:32.417
- Looks so small.
- That's because it's quite far away.

4199854271
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.500
Gimme that.

3431711049
00:31:37.334 --> 00:31:39.042
Oh, look at that.

2850483862
00:31:40.542 --> 00:31:42.792
Do you think that's
because four people have died?

1464394800
00:31:43.792 --> 00:31:44.834
Not yet.

3299755025
00:31:45.417 --> 00:31:47.542
Oi! Jessie and me
are gonna go for a swim.

3919877755
00:31:48.167 --> 00:31:50.167
- Oh, will you be careful, though?
- No.

1973445717
00:31:50.292 --> 00:31:52.125
- You gonna be all right on your own?
- No.

3229045105
00:31:55.292 --> 00:31:58.709
- Pair of idiots.
- Do you think they're happy?

2291761182
00:32:00.626 --> 00:32:02.876
Honestly, right now,
I couldn't give.

1254604419
00:32:13.042 --> 00:32:14.125
Hey, Detective.

2545831353
00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.417
- How is Yanet?
- Yanet died.

3006736438
00:32:21.334 --> 00:32:24.667
This is the way of life. It ends.

1147512379
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:26.709
It does end.

1645118262
00:32:28.292 --> 00:32:29.709
Have you seen Johan today?

1981400135
00:32:31.667 --> 00:32:35.209
I saw him getting off the ferry
yesterday, very drunk.

219096705
00:32:35.834 --> 00:32:38.500
Oh my, this is serious.

1168433647
00:32:39.375 --> 00:32:41.334
He's only just been released.

424889746
00:32:42.417 --> 00:32:45.834
- Have you alerted the community?
- Not yet.

2521541415
00:32:46.751 --> 00:32:48.459
Klara will want to know.

1627781395
00:32:59.834 --> 00:33:02.667
- I'm sorry to...
- Stop!

2900294641
00:33:05.375 --> 00:33:08.000
How dare you interrupt my rehearsal?

2015677682
00:33:09.167 --> 00:33:10.542
Murder.

4053602830
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:15.918
That's why. I'm sure you'll understand
death comes before art.

2711152106
00:33:22.709 --> 00:33:25.834
- Do you know Johan?
- The Dane?

660362199
00:33:26.751 --> 00:33:28.626
- Have you seen him today?
- Nej.

3772964527
00:33:32.584 --> 00:33:35.167
Did any of you see him?

4269646391
00:33:36.584 --> 00:33:39.751
- He left the island.
- Are you sure?

818553150
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.250
Do you know where he went?

639361232
00:33:42.375 --> 00:33:45.083
Probably to the Systembolaget
to get more vodka.

692588668
00:33:49.876 --> 00:33:52.250
- Thank you for your time.
- Good.

3022984561
00:33:52.375 --> 00:33:54.375
Leave this place and don't come back.

3495343849
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:59.167
You have no jurisdiction here,
Detective Forsberg.

4158224676
00:33:59.292 --> 00:34:03.250
In here, the Karant n is judge.

922620804
00:34:03.375 --> 00:34:09.167
It is our way. It has always been our way.

3944568301
00:34:10.334 --> 00:34:11.918
FORSBERG: Be careful.

946475567
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.751
I'd hate for you to do something rash
and lose your head.

2208559481
00:34:40.584 --> 00:34:43.042
Hey! Hey! We are closing soon,

1702363798
00:34:43.167 --> 00:34:45.751
but would you like
to taste my crispy waffle?

2233573446
00:34:45.876 --> 00:34:49.125
Waffle? Yes, please!

4204979369
00:34:55.292 --> 00:34:57.250
Coming here was a big mistake for you.

3334262694
00:34:57.751 --> 00:35:01.334
- Why? Are your waffles?
- How dare you?

1527347645
00:35:07.876 --> 00:35:09.751
It's fine, we'll leave.

486467542
00:35:11.292 --> 00:35:12.542
Yes.

182936475
00:35:13.125 --> 00:35:14.876
- You will.
- OK, you know what?

4109029300
00:35:14.999 --> 00:35:16.792
We didn't want to be here, mate, OK?

3706353417
00:35:16.918 --> 00:35:19.459
We're only here because our parents
want to see a stupid play.

456706152
00:35:19.918 --> 00:35:21.083
Not a play.

1004489398
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.626
OK, and you know what?
Your waffles look dry as anyway.

3774868673
00:35:24.751 --> 00:35:27.334
My waffles... are moist!

482078152
00:35:28.334 --> 00:35:30.876
- They don't look it, so...
- Don't touch me.

4148955248
00:35:33.792 --> 00:35:37.417
- My eyes!
- OK, let's go.

2357543268
00:36:16.918 --> 00:36:20.334
- Oh.
- Oh!

3796420111
00:36:21.167 --> 00:36:23.292
I mean,
the nameplate said English liars.

209111974
00:36:23.417 --> 00:36:27.292
This is so weird.
What is happening, for sake?

2758670268
00:36:27.834 --> 00:36:31.626
- We should tell the others.
- No, no, don't. Um...

3496314932
00:36:31.751 --> 00:36:34.751
I don't want Mum to miss the play.
She's been trying so hard.

2857638490
00:36:35.334 --> 00:36:37.209
Sam, will you put the kettle on?

1486220974
00:36:49.125 --> 00:36:50.417
Sam, have you...

3856260663
00:36:50.834 --> 00:36:53.375
- Have you been in here?
- No, why?

362014753
00:36:54.834 --> 00:36:56.083
Um...

1569777947
00:36:56.626 --> 00:37:00.000
Be honest. Did you, um...
Did you move my underwear?

116065714
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.375
You're being shifty as
right now, Sam.

2664673002
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.667
I'm not. Sorry. I'm nervous.

590635135
00:37:07.125 --> 00:37:11.000
OK, look,
if you took them to seagull off into,

2895197400
00:37:11.125 --> 00:37:15.167
or have a sniff, whatever, OK,
I don't care, I just want them back.

3894749654
00:37:15.292 --> 00:37:18.626
- They were Ł22.
- Ugh. Seagull?

3277514322
00:37:18.751 --> 00:37:20.459
Don't be weird.

1455580138
00:37:21.334 --> 00:37:22.292
I'm gay.

3191661868
00:37:22.417 --> 00:37:24.000
Oh.

1366612625
00:37:24.125 --> 00:37:28.083
- OK. Well, I didn't know that about you.
- There's lots you don't know about me.

3510186233
00:37:28.209 --> 00:37:30.500
- I'm sure there is.
- Well, there are.

21545559
00:38:25.334 --> 00:38:29.959
You have all worked very hard
the last ten months.

43031540
00:38:31.626 --> 00:38:33.083
Well done.

457315529
00:38:34.209 --> 00:38:36.834
I have worked hard all my life.

3724576976
00:38:37.375 --> 00:38:39.375
It's what I do.

1792480374
00:38:40.918 --> 00:38:44.918
I have been doing this successfully
for many years now.

1196937344
00:38:45.375 --> 00:38:48.250
Many Karant ns.

980524389
00:38:50.709 --> 00:38:55.042
But soon my time will end,

1367236223
00:38:55.584 --> 00:39:02.500
and it will be time for one of you to
become the custodian of our traditions.

301554553
00:39:07.626 --> 00:39:11.792
I am proud and honoured to say

3015289162
00:39:12.459 --> 00:39:14.584
that I have been shown a way,

2500969003
00:39:15.167 --> 00:39:22.375
and have been given the opportunity
very recently to close the circle.

681645363
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:27.709
It would be great to have some clarity

120693114
00:39:27.834 --> 00:39:30.250
about what you mean when you say,
"Close the circle."

2179975556
00:39:30.375 --> 00:39:33.584
In years gone by,

3121319788
00:39:33.709 --> 00:39:37.417
we honoured the traditions
by sacrificing tributes.

575464815
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.751
I guess as much as we want
to honour the dead of the Karant n,

2945537108
00:39:45.876 --> 00:39:49.959
the thought that you would want us to...

443133770
00:39:50.042 --> 00:39:55.751
I think what Marten is trying to say
is that the thought of having to...

4225515050
00:39:55.876 --> 00:39:58.584
Speak your mind, Ingemar.

3608482606
00:39:58.959 --> 00:40:00.334
Kill again.

893853331
00:40:00.959 --> 00:40:02.834
It seems very old-fashioned.

1313699595
00:40:03.876 --> 00:40:07.000
I know it was our way in the past,
but now...

2466083487
00:40:07.709 --> 00:40:12.667
The English arriving here
has solidified my resolve.

6268057
00:40:13.542 --> 00:40:18.250
It offered me an unsurpassed clarity.

3115621684
00:40:20.626 --> 00:40:23.709
The English must be offered up.

2318672462
00:40:24.918 --> 00:40:28.167
It will be
the greatest modern Karant n ever.

948627306
00:40:29.542 --> 00:40:32.334
I thought
we were just going to scare them off!

4033330238
00:40:33.167 --> 00:40:35.751
The last time
we honoured the Karant n in this way,

2819703347
00:40:35.876 --> 00:40:37.125
we were all much younger.

1601107119
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:39.334
I wasn't even born yet!

240488046
00:40:39.459 --> 00:40:42.876
- The world was different then.
- Was it?

3104711810
00:40:42.999 --> 00:40:45.626
I don't think it was that different.

3012395588
00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:51.626
I remember you that summer,
Sven Svensson.

3572567193
00:40:51.751 --> 00:40:54.542
You couldn't wait
to kill those poor people.

2522450120
00:40:54.959 --> 00:40:58.000
We won't kill and eat people.

1535961694
00:40:58.918 --> 00:41:02.417
We love the Karant n
and our culture and traditions, but...

261710152
00:41:02.542 --> 00:41:04.999
You will do what I tell you to do!

3553389802
00:41:05.626 --> 00:41:09.000
You will not
this opportunity up for me.

1410399047
00:41:30.959 --> 00:41:32.500
Jesus!

1389722203
00:41:34.876 --> 00:41:36.834
These potatoes are.

1554524129
00:41:37.834 --> 00:41:39.667
Jens, do you...

1655352556
00:41:42.542 --> 00:41:45.292
Matts Larsson, how are you?

298927963
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.292
I assume you received a visit
from Detective Forsberg.

1036914244
00:41:53.209 --> 00:41:57.959
A policeman on the island
at the time of Karant n is bad.

1494808106
00:41:58.042 --> 00:42:02.500
As you know, a lot of work
has gone into this year's production.

2970608061
00:42:02.876 --> 00:42:04.375
As always.

744718999
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:08.584
And the Karant n
will go ahead as it always has.

593557160
00:42:09.167 --> 00:42:12.876
Our debt must be paid.

487806605
00:42:13.626 --> 00:42:15.542
- You know this.
- Yes.

3794973244
00:42:16.083 --> 00:42:19.876
Bringing those people here
was wrong, Matts.

2486520920
00:42:20.417 --> 00:42:23.959
The commune did not approve
such a request,

499129320
00:42:24.042 --> 00:42:26.500
and look what has happened.

278362739
00:42:26.626 --> 00:42:28.292
Why should I have to get the approval

2371613256
00:42:28.417 --> 00:42:32.918
of a commune
that barely recognises my existence?

4216127065
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.125
Because it is our way.

911858692
00:42:35.918 --> 00:42:38.250
It is the way of Sv lta,

995157434
00:42:38.375 --> 00:42:41.709
ever since the first Karant n,
Matts Larsson.

326086153
00:42:41.834 --> 00:42:43.626
You do what you want.

635950907
00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:45.667
You come and go.

3794986162
00:42:46.334 --> 00:42:50.375
Drunk pretty girls, pretty boys.
They arrive laughing.

908897133
00:42:50.542 --> 00:42:54.292
They leave crying. We see this.

3652967945
00:42:55.918 --> 00:43:00.334
You prey on weakness, beauty.

784544350
00:43:00.626 --> 00:43:05.375
You are a pervert,
an alcoholic, a drug-taking pig.

1533973568
00:43:06.709 --> 00:43:11.209
I make sure that we turn a blind eye

2870142598
00:43:11.334 --> 00:43:14.626
to these indiscretions.

4095486533
00:43:14.751 --> 00:43:18.667
Do you know why I do this?

1061450569
00:43:19.918 --> 00:43:21.167
Hmm?

2346591254
00:43:21.667 --> 00:43:26.709
Because you are one of us.

1128344915
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.250
That could very easily change.

1285582034
00:43:32.292 --> 00:43:34.751
- Do you understand?
- What do you want?

1103936824
00:43:35.667 --> 00:43:39.209
It's 200 years since the Karant n began.

1990071736
00:43:40.375 --> 00:43:42.459
This is a big deal, I think.

3503421539
00:43:43.125 --> 00:43:47.167
I feel this anniversary
be celebrated in the old style.

2354697314
00:43:47.292 --> 00:43:49.751
There are some who think that...

836984159
00:43:49.876 --> 00:43:51.584
about what went before.

1249113795
00:43:51.709 --> 00:43:55.042
They no longer have the stomach
for the old ways.

4293327079
00:43:55.167 --> 00:43:58.542
I think you might. Hmm?

1476077659
00:43:59.125 --> 00:44:02.125
We haven't done that for 30 years, so...

321568128
00:44:03.834 --> 00:44:09.000
When the Karant n is complete tomorrow,
I will come to your home,

3626048197
00:44:09.125 --> 00:44:12.542
and we will put things right together.

797872675
00:44:13.167 --> 00:44:15.751
We shall eat roast beef.

205473790
00:44:16.542 --> 00:44:18.250
The old way.

3047029023
00:44:35.417 --> 00:44:38.375
Perhaps our friends
would like some nice cookies.

2695460146
00:44:39.459 --> 00:44:41.584
Do you have everything
you need for this recipe?

1984353424
00:45:32.626 --> 00:45:34.000
Mmm...

2952167302
00:45:34.125 --> 00:45:36.500
You moan about my little plastic bags
of bits and bobs,

87129986
00:45:36.626 --> 00:45:38.999
but I bet you're glad
I brought my own teabags from home now.

3903350065
00:45:39.083 --> 00:45:41.167
Yeah. Absolutely delicious.

708981763
00:45:41.292 --> 00:45:45.626
- I will never doubt you again, Mummy!
- Oh! Can I have that in writing, Daddy?

4045715960
00:45:47.459 --> 00:45:50.959
Aw. Mmm.

1000270398
00:45:51.042 --> 00:45:52.834
- Did you sleep OK?
- Yeah, I did.

3702631941
00:45:52.959 --> 00:45:54.999
- Yeah?
- It was deep, and...

4131602840
00:45:55.375 --> 00:45:57.709
I just feel really refreshed here.

1100856376
00:45:58.209 --> 00:46:01.250
- You?
- Same. Just relaxed.

3032059557
00:46:01.959 --> 00:46:04.125
I finished what I was saying.

669986139
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:05.626
- Ah! Hello, gang!
- Morning.

291460139
00:46:05.751 --> 00:46:07.417
- Morning.
- Everything all right last night?

2314232536
00:46:07.542 --> 00:46:09.417
- Yeah, it was fine.
- Let's eat!

4111885206
00:46:09.542 --> 00:46:11.334
- Whoo!
- Daddy!

4058511390
00:46:13.542 --> 00:46:15.375
I don't want
to have to keep virtue signalling,

3952563135
00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:16.876
but I'm not gonna eat this.

550399730
00:46:16.999 --> 00:46:18.751
Well, then just eat the egg, Sam.

2661022299
00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:21.042
I'm not gonna eat
an undeveloped hen foetus.

3022438287
00:46:21.167 --> 00:46:24.375
- Hen foetus? It's a egg.
- You're a egg.

1549565522
00:46:26.626 --> 00:46:27.667
- Don't call me that.
- Sam.

3871478552
00:46:27.792 --> 00:46:28.876
Don't call me that.

3651105940
00:46:28.999 --> 00:46:31.167
- Egg. Why would you say egg?
-  Richard, please.

1330961727
00:46:32.125 --> 00:46:33.626
Don't call Daddy an egg.

2870687087
00:46:35.042 --> 00:46:37.834
OK?
Now, why don't we finish up breakfast,

3794212829
00:46:37.959 --> 00:46:40.626
and go and get dressed?
Because today is the big day.

3525179597
00:46:40.751 --> 00:46:44.125
- Yeah. Today is the big day!
- Whoo!

281463015
00:47:02.709 --> 00:47:05.792
Good news.
I had a little chat with the commune,

2786982658
00:47:05.918 --> 00:47:11.500
and they decided that you guys
are more than welcome to see the play.

1246062881
00:47:12.125 --> 00:47:14.417
They even reserved seats for you.

1982061486
00:47:15.042 --> 00:47:17.209
Great, thank you.

645129967
00:47:18.167 --> 00:47:21.500
Are you not heading out
to see the Karant n?

3986871106
00:47:21.626 --> 00:47:23.792
- Nope.
- Going for a swim in the harbour.

1830826428
00:47:24.709 --> 00:47:28.042
I thought you came here
specifically to see the play.

393025869
00:47:28.167 --> 00:47:30.500
- Not all of it, mate.
- It's eight hours long, babe!

2735410928
00:47:30.626 --> 00:47:33.083
I guarantee you, though,
we shan't miss the climax.

2639633896
00:47:33.209 --> 00:47:36.292
- Are you back for lunch?
- Oh, absolutely.

3875583511
00:47:36.417 --> 00:47:39.459
Great! I have a surprise for you.

3346547636
00:48:23.959 --> 00:48:28.667
Nej! I don't want to gobble your kaka.

3461625171
00:48:28.792 --> 00:48:33.292
Not while the rest of the commune
struggles so.

476498033
00:48:34.375 --> 00:48:35.959
As you wish.

1102153795
00:48:36.042 --> 00:48:39.209
But know
the mainland is still rife with disease.

2041601131
00:48:39.334 --> 00:48:40.709
Many thousands dead.

938522061
00:48:40.834 --> 00:48:42.626
Many more dying.

4227400794
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.751
It will be months
before you get the chance

830112658
00:48:44.876 --> 00:48:46.751
to eat a moist kaka again.

3877419967
00:48:54.417 --> 00:48:58.083
Why won't you open the harbour?

1129525608
00:48:58.209 --> 00:48:59.709
As the leader of this community,

2262158890
00:48:59.834 --> 00:49:02.417
I have decided
to keep the harbour closed for now.

3685220805
00:49:02.542 --> 00:49:04.751
It is for the best.

1012933589
00:49:09.751 --> 00:49:15.334
But for how long?
We can't take this much more.

1730395162
00:49:15.459 --> 00:49:18.292
Our English friends shall let us know
when it is safe to lift the Karant n.

3982081977
00:49:24.959 --> 00:49:27.584
No! Stop it!

2644655838
00:49:28.918 --> 00:49:31.459
Now perhaps
I will feast upon your sweet kaka.

2427868528
00:49:31.876 --> 00:49:33.542
Nej!

1397343747
00:49:38.375 --> 00:49:40.334
- Splash! Splashy!
- Sam, knock it off.

384997889
00:49:40.459 --> 00:49:44.000
Sam! Sam, come on!

4193142818
00:49:44.125 --> 00:49:46.417
And you get one! And you and you!

1577792868
00:49:46.542 --> 00:49:48.459
Stop! Oh, grow up.

2603677177
00:49:49.334 --> 00:49:53.250
I... have received word
from our English friends.

57732223
00:49:56.626 --> 00:50:01.083
- I'm afraid the Karant n must endure.
- Nej!

1439915305
00:50:01.209 --> 00:50:04.209
Our children and families are dead.

2069330321
00:50:04.918 --> 00:50:08.584
We are weak
and many are close to the end.

1101237835
00:50:12.999 --> 00:50:15.167
People have started to eat the dead.

1316991314
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.918
I didn't know they were dead!

1735660871
00:50:39.959 --> 00:50:41.417
Oh!

2165613058
00:50:41.876 --> 00:50:44.000
Well, that's nice.

2199777251
00:50:44.125 --> 00:50:46.792
Looks like
it's time for a cup of tea and...

3808367525
00:50:46.918 --> 00:50:48.459
- Biccies!
- Yay.

2729618356
00:50:50.959 --> 00:50:52.959
Traitor! Turncoat!

375010556
00:50:53.918 --> 00:50:55.250
Traitor!

601779499
00:50:55.375 --> 00:50:57.834
Soon the whole island will be dead.

3981681243
00:50:58.209 --> 00:50:59.959
And who will profit then?

2328418641
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.083
What's wrong, Mr Larsson?

679318947
00:51:05.626 --> 00:51:09.959
Are you losing the stomach for it?
I think not.

3874873338
00:51:14.417 --> 00:51:16.250
I have let friends die.

2494092890
00:51:17.209 --> 00:51:19.292
Wives have lost husbands.

2883543254
00:51:20.209 --> 00:51:23.209
Fathers have buried children. Why?

2743860121
00:51:24.125 --> 00:51:26.918
- There is no disease!
- Nej!

1453111300
00:51:30.584 --> 00:51:33.334
I never imagined the horror
our deal would bring.

2545728182
00:51:33.876 --> 00:51:38.918
What did you think
would happen, old thing?

608730405
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:43.250
They grow thin and weak
while you grow fat and rich.

45269251
00:51:49.876 --> 00:51:53.417
Nej!

3829730388
00:51:53.542 --> 00:51:55.000
You're a turncoat!

3425620083
00:52:05.834 --> 00:52:07.209
Hmm.

2220819060
00:52:07.792 --> 00:52:09.709
Hmm, these are unusual.

1527052762
00:52:11.417 --> 00:52:13.834
- Gross.
- They're really dry.

3167597002
00:52:13.959 --> 00:52:15.709
- I think that's...
- You could...

3186547374
00:52:15.834 --> 00:52:18.876
What? Dry!

2064628863
00:52:20.292 --> 00:52:23.334
Yeah, dig in. Enjoy.

739155687
00:52:27.542 --> 00:52:30.709
Your lies will weaken us no more.

3042993212
00:52:31.876 --> 00:52:36.667
You will suffer as we have suffered.

4275298270
00:52:37.626 --> 00:52:42.709
Might I beg your pardon for one last wish

2841059748
00:52:43.709 --> 00:52:47.000
before you pass your final judgement?

3392600337
00:52:47.584 --> 00:52:48.542
Ja.

3636679112
00:52:51.959 --> 00:52:57.209
God save our gracious King

3387254825
00:52:57.334 --> 00:53:02.500

01:05:54.209 --> 01:05:56.292
Johan the Dane
has been spotted on the island.

3926113760
01:05:56.417 --> 01:05:58.584
- I am serious.
- Wake Peter.

1488837412
01:05:58.709 --> 01:06:01.542
- Why?
- Tell him... I need Lucky Linda.

3953715429
01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:03.083
What? What does Peter
have to do with...

2962141408
01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:06.500
- Tell Peter I need Lucky Linda. Do it!
- Johan just went berserk!

1694247746
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.083
Why don't you eff off, Sam?
It was nice before you arrived.

482736947
01:06:12.209 --> 01:06:13.834
Why don't you off, Dad?

3603656766
01:06:15.042 --> 01:06:16.999
You should checkity check yourself, boy.

1483423534
01:06:17.083 --> 01:06:19.626
- Should I?
- Yeah, you should.

1261971519
01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:23.500
- You've got on my tits this trip.
- Have I?

3753017216
01:06:25.959 --> 01:06:26.918
Yeah, you have.

3919743757
01:06:36.751 --> 01:06:40.250
Or should I say Ian?

2298698826
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.999
I'm sorry
we invited you back after last time.

3547391305
01:06:46.083 --> 01:06:48.918
- Why did you do that? That is so naughty.
- Oh, my God!

3309307234
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.542
9Why? OK, why?
His attitude generally is. Uh...

2925015933
01:06:54.667 --> 01:06:58.125
His characterisation
is 2D and clich,, at best,

2542056131
01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:01.876
and his personal hygiene
is absolutely disgusting.

27392684
01:07:03.417 --> 01:07:07.667
It's because I have AD...HD.

2716333520
01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:12.751
Yeah. Well, now you got D-E-A-D.

591151
01:07:12.876 --> 01:07:14.918
- Well done, Dad.
- Brilliant, Richard, brilliant.

2480910448
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.709
And who is going to have
to sort all of this out?

2187227877
01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:19.709
- Muggins over here. Muggins.
- You know what?

3924873638
01:07:19.834 --> 01:07:22.999
I just that we could talk about things
before it gets to this point.

1516985171
01:07:23.083 --> 01:07:24.834
- Exactly.
- You know what I mean? Just before.

390700882
01:07:24.959 --> 01:07:27.959
I'll have to spend two hours
on the phone to international clean-up,

1525741675
01:07:28.083 --> 01:07:29.626
You know what the worst thing is?

2736541271
01:07:29.751 --> 01:07:32.334
Now we have to go out
and source an entire new brother.

3014956617
01:07:32.459 --> 01:07:34.999
- And that's a task in itself.
- All right. I'm sorry, all right?

3702200672
01:07:35.083 --> 01:07:37.417
But just hear me out, all right?

1563977680
01:07:37.542 --> 01:07:39.542
- I...
- Do we forgive him?

1889028247
01:07:39.667 --> 01:07:42.375
Um...

1841766228
01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.417
Hey, stop teasing me!
You're not really whispering.

3400018143
01:07:47.417 --> 01:07:50.667
OK, let's go back to the house
and have nice cup of tea.

3239339675
01:07:50.792 --> 01:07:52.083
- Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

2965084193
01:07:53.751 --> 01:07:56.667
Come on, baby, come on.

17680596
01:07:59.334 --> 01:08:00.834
Now who's a egg?

1695079450
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.459
Klara, Klara, wait.

177230664
01:08:13.834 --> 01:08:15.626
You're still determined to pay tribute?

345047785
01:08:15.751 --> 01:08:18.167
Perhaps it is the want
of the Karant n.

3128070277
01:08:18.292 --> 01:08:19.250
Enough!

2856259713
01:08:19.709 --> 01:08:21.334
There is little room for those old ways.

3049383165
01:08:23.209 --> 01:08:26.500
Sven Svensson, I love you.

1619960030
01:08:26.626 --> 01:08:29.626
I could not have wished for a better son.

684194055
01:08:30.209 --> 01:08:33.334
When you are in charge,

4097200489
01:08:34.959 --> 01:08:37.417
you can do whatever you want.

1090301579
01:08:38.542 --> 01:08:41.626
But tonight, this is for me.

3147570471
01:08:43.459 --> 01:08:46.375
Help me complete the Karant n.

373128004
01:08:48.459 --> 01:08:50.667
I will make a tribute with you
one last time.

2074545961
01:08:57.792 --> 01:09:00.042
Just let me go to my home
and get my shotgun.

2321398012
01:09:00.167 --> 01:09:03.500
I know. Oh, God.

1484224391
01:09:05.667 --> 01:09:07.834
Go back to the house. Quick, Daddy.

4169344476
01:09:16.417 --> 01:09:20.083
- I told you!
- Yeah. Yeah, you did.

1007989076
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:22.584
Disgusting! That pervert.

1886538945
01:09:22.626 --> 01:09:23.999
Where do you think this leads?

2769796792
01:09:24.083 --> 01:09:25.959
Obviously,
it leads back to the house, Richard.

311882487
01:09:26.042 --> 01:09:28.375
Yeah, no, I know.
I'm just trying to be rhetorical.

1596571355
01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.500
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I didn't get that, sorry.

1140039532
01:09:30.626 --> 01:09:32.417
- How do you want to do this?
- Well, Daddy...

3615786488
01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:35.125
There's someone
I've been very impressed with this week.

111087470
01:09:35.542 --> 01:09:36.500
Who's that, Mummy?

3857189552
01:09:36.626 --> 01:09:40.959
It is someone
who is a very good girl indeed.

4003332120
01:09:41.042 --> 01:09:42.000
Right.

1676935168
01:09:42.125 --> 01:09:46.667
And who is blooming into
quite the lovely young lunatic.

4053351053
01:09:46.792 --> 01:09:48.918
Stop it!

2525586901
01:09:49.125 --> 01:09:50.999
I wonder where she gets that from.

4203181045
01:09:51.083 --> 01:09:52.500
I think that, um...

296355774
01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:56.834
I think that Jessie is ready to lead
her first Trojan Horse.

1096397059
01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:58.626
Yes! Get in!

1315978315
01:09:59.125 --> 01:10:00.792
Well deserved. Well done.

736037025
01:10:00.918 --> 01:10:01.959
- Well done, you.
- It's time.

1040861896
01:10:02.042 --> 01:10:04.918
- Do you really want to do that?
- Go on, I'll meet you round there.

801045435
01:10:05.375 --> 01:10:07.083
- Love you guys!
- Yeah.

2457482463
01:10:07.209 --> 01:10:08.542
Whoo!

2558067684
01:10:09.459 --> 01:10:11.999
- You coming?
- No, I'm going to, uh...

3480215452
01:10:12.334 --> 01:10:14.417
I'm going to put my feet up
and watch it on the telly.

1515494105
01:10:14.542 --> 01:10:16.167
All right, I'll see you there.

3898766180
01:10:53.876 --> 01:10:56.417
Help me.

496691582
01:11:05.542 --> 01:11:07.999
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

3398192627
01:11:08.083 --> 01:11:09.751
He killed them!

3520206911
01:11:09.876 --> 01:11:10.999
No, no, no, OK.

577041354
01:11:11.083 --> 01:11:13.459
He killed my dad,
he killed my brother. OK, OK.

1737169527
01:11:14.042 --> 01:11:16.000
Who? Who did?

3137914191
01:11:16.876 --> 01:11:18.667
Matts Larsson.

2574959975
01:11:19.083 --> 01:11:21.959
Matts Larsson? How?

560022844
01:11:22.751 --> 01:11:25.167
When did he do this? Why?

370912991
01:11:25.292 --> 01:11:27.417
I don't know, I don't know.
He just went berserk.

462647869
01:11:27.876 --> 01:11:29.626
I've lost, I've lost everyone.

2890438246
01:11:30.042 --> 01:11:33.792
What do you know about loss?
Ha! You will know.

3421520149
01:11:34.542 --> 01:11:35.626
What did you say?

2274147779
01:11:37.292 --> 01:11:39.167
OK, come, come, come here.

724813737
01:11:40.876 --> 01:11:43.999
- What is it?
- He's still here.

499489223
01:11:47.125 --> 01:11:49.751
- I must check the rest of the house.
- No, no, no, no, just...

590744752
01:11:49.876 --> 01:11:51.834
Please don't!
Please don't leave me on my own!

2664679188
01:11:51.959 --> 01:11:54.584
I'm so scared! I'm so scared!
Please don't!

2848913610
01:11:56.834 --> 01:11:59.209
Tell me, girl.

1064964097
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:02.000
Where are your family now?

290350367
01:12:04.083 --> 01:12:06.209
Where are their bodies?

1075986663
01:12:07.334 --> 01:12:08.667
He ate them.

2866758720
01:12:10.334 --> 01:12:12.167
He better not have!

3580758562
01:12:14.542 --> 01:12:17.584
No, no, no, don't! Don't open it!
Don't open it! It might be a psychopath.

1408202241
01:12:21.125 --> 01:12:25.167
You let me in! You witch, you let me in!

896833335
01:12:25.292 --> 01:12:28.792
Get away from my baby! Baby? Baby!

2251653178
01:12:28.918 --> 01:12:31.000
- Mummy!
- Baby!

2825023569
01:12:31.125 --> 01:12:33.834
- It is a psychopath.
- Oh, no!

858143941
01:13:09.959 --> 01:13:11.375
Hey?

4090654641
01:13:12.751 --> 01:13:14.292
Hello?

565744805
01:13:18.999 --> 01:13:20.667
Please help me.

1611761820
01:13:43.542 --> 01:13:45.000
Mummy!

79956378
01:13:45.125 --> 01:13:46.334
Sven Svensson!

3462232649
01:13:47.042 --> 01:13:48.500
Come down this moment.

3298264406
01:13:50.792 --> 01:13:51.876
Sven Svensson!

1441923998
01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:02.999
- They blew my hand off.
- Oh, Daddy!

3135927653
01:14:03.375 --> 01:14:05.876
- You'll have to wank southpaw now.
- No, no, no, it's too soon.

898104763
01:14:05.999 --> 01:14:07.751
- It's too soon.
- Sorry.

181677183
01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:08.834
Hello.

99427989
01:14:10.417 --> 01:14:11.626
Huh?

963438840
01:14:13.167 --> 01:14:15.918
It was you! The English.

861281254
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.584
Of course.

773156496
01:14:17.834 --> 01:14:20.083
History repeats itself once again.

3635825145
01:14:20.999 --> 01:14:23.542
The English lied to a Larsson.

4109383930
01:14:24.584 --> 01:14:30.083
I now realise that the Karant n itself
was but a dress rehearsal.

2510571260
01:14:30.751 --> 01:14:34.751
This is the real performance.

579789574
01:14:49.417 --> 01:14:52.292
- They killed my boy!
- Mamma! Mamma!

1860241468
01:14:52.417 --> 01:14:54.584
They took the hand I write with.

3132945002
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:57.751
You need to leave. Right now.

862956901
01:14:57.876 --> 01:14:59.125
- Go!
-  Yes.

578511325
01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:00.209
- Come on, Daddy.
- Go!

4221326278
01:15:00.334 --> 01:15:02.042
- Yeah.
- Come on, baby. Come on.

2130263117
01:15:03.542 --> 01:15:05.584
Excuse me. Come on, baby.

( "I EAT CANNIBALS" BY BARRY BLUE)

2957977019
01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:25.417
- That's Johan the Dane!
- He's getting away!

1944017015
01:15:26.918 --> 01:15:28.876
Freeze!

2342575067
01:15:34.584 --> 01:15:38.876
- That was the best holiday ever.
- Well, you know what they say, gang.

3009590794
01:15:39.459 --> 01:15:41.918
The family that slay together...

1741204407
01:15:42.292 --> 01:15:44.250
Stay together!

2938995821
01:15:45.417 --> 01:15:46.959
Daddy.

1664413976
01:15:48.167 --> 01:15:51.375
You're a cheese ball, but I love you.
