WEBVTT

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.680
Hey, you Mr Lawyer?

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.960
We're recording you, girl.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.280
- Won't you spare us a glance?
- Let's go.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.200
That's more like it.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.880
Oh, she saw. She is staring!

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.280
What are you saying?

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.720
You carry on, I'll join. Okay.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.800
This is for your stupid brother.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.120
Valentine's gift.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.520
Sister.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.360
Can I get some water...

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.760
Thank you.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.400
Thank you, sister.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.040
Attention please.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.560
The college boxing centre will accept
student applications from next week.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.320
Students who want to enrol themselves,

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.640
must meet Coach Sunil Mahajan
at the boxing centre.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.560
How's the construction
coming along, Sunil?

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.360
All good on with the interiors.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.680
Need a couple of days
to finish the exteriors.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.840
The Chief will be inspecting personally.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.400
Hope you're not thinking
of getting into boxing and all?

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.320
It's about survival, sister.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.640
And only the fittest survive.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.960
I have been thinking...

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.400
Either a job under sports quota
or Masters?

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.680
Once I am out of here,

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.840
there will be no stopping this bird.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.200
Brother!

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.200
When did you get here?

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.600
Are you going to ask me everything
from down there itself?

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.440
You little one!

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.800
Come up! I'll tell you everything.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.520
Come here. Come here.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.360
Did Aarti give you
a Valentines gift for me?

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.040
- You didn't tell me.
- Sorry, sorry.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.240
What sorry sorry?

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.800
Here you go.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.760
Please, brother...

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.080
Next time, find another way
to exchange gifts, please.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.320
- iPhone!
- Shut up!

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.880
What happened?

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.400
Why are you two screaming?

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.200
No, it's nothing.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.240
iPhone?

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.240
Personal number. Only for Aarti.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.320
Brother.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.840
Please, brother.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.720
Control yourself, please.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.800
- She comes from a high caste.
- What high caste?

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.520
What if her family says no?

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.400
You will get us killed.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.960
- All of us killed.
- Shut up!

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.840
I won't let anyone die
while I am alive.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.720
And if it comes to that
after I am dead,

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.440
then I will turn into a ghost
and come save you!

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.840
Come here.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.160
Come here, girl. Come on.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.480
Don't worry.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.040
Tell me something, Gehnu?

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.640
Have you met my little sister?

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.440
I heard she will be learning boxing.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.320
Bam!

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.600
She will surely save you.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.440
Now get ready for the wedding.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.400
Bloody hell.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.640
Whose daughter did you say
it was, Raj Kishore?

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.160
Meghwal's daughter
from Hariyali village.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.760
Come on, let's go.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.840
Hurry up.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.400
Move it.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.960
Ratanlal, keep the manor ready!

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.160
Shift to fifth (gear) now!

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.120
Let's go. Let's go.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.760
Let's go. Let's go.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.760
Come on, let's go.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.320
Stop. Park here.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.600
Bloody hell.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.400
Come over here.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.320
Step behind.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.040
Do you want to get shot?

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.640
Come on, guys.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.120
Get out. Get out.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.080
Come out, rascal.
Come out.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.440
Bring the girl out!
Where have you hidden her?

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.120
Priest. Stop this right now.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.320
What sort of compulsion is this?

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.040
When we told you

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.480
to think about your caste

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.280
and the community
before arranging the marriage.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.960
Then why didn't you?

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.520
Don't forget your stature.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.160
What is the problem?
The groom's family doesn't mind!

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.760
But we bloody well do!

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.080
Look down. Look down.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.200
You don't have permission to look up!

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.240
Look down!

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.640
Bring the girl out!

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.720
Let her go.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.640
Drag her out.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.760
Beat up.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.000
Save me.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.400
Don't talk.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.600
Careful. Careful with her.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.960
She is our entertainment for tonight

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:39.880
Definitely brother!!!

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.080
Save me.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.480
Turn on the car.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.960
Her crying is like music to my ears.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.200
Lower the camera.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.360
Dalits are treated no better
than the dirt beneath the soles of feet...

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.600
There must be a protector,

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.080
that Mother Goddess has chosen for us.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.640
I don't want a protector.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.200
If there is, I want someone

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.320
who can turn the soles of my feet
into unbreakable weapons.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.040
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.080
Dr. Mashoor Rao.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.120
I have come from Mursheedabad.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.960
Dr. Rao.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.400
- Yes, tell me.
- Doctor.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.120
Where is Dr. Naseem?

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.960
He is in Tangmarg.
Stuck in a snowstorm.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.840
I can give you his number
if you don't believe me.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.880
You can call him.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.640
Take him inside to sister.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:28.800
Sir, latest information.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.880
Major Kanwar has entered the compound.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.080
At ease.
Good.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.720
How long before we have eyes?

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.720
We're on it, sir.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.480
Pack your bags, we need to leave quickly.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.840
Arre, drink some Kawha and leave...

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.640
Make sure you have something and go.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.840
You need to hold the handle firmly!

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.520
Take three people along with you.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.000
Be careful!!!

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.320
Finally the doctor is here.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.440
We're live, sir.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.240
Doctor.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.040
His fever has not gone
down since 2 days.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.520
And since yesterday,

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.400
he's been having trouble breathing.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.160
Okay. Let me examine him.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.400
Doctor, hurry up.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.600
Take deep breaths, son.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.520
Can we zoom in on this?

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.840
Sir, retina match.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.000
It's Illiyas Kashmiri.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.840
Confirmed.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.880
I've got Iliyas in my sight, sir.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.960
Permission to engage.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.760
Track and extract only.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.320
Please, sir. I can take him down.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.440
He has vital information.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.640
We can get it out of him.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.760
You will stick to the plan, officer.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.880
We need him.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.880
- Alive!
- Shit.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.400
I'm giving medication for now.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.440
But we have
to shift him to a hospital.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.360
Okay.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.760
I'm calling an ambulance.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.240
Doctor.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.480
What's that written on your arm?

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.040
Jai Maa Kaali. Aayo Gorkhali!
(Hail Maa Kaali. The Gorkhas are here.)

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.040
Take this phoney doctor downstairs.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.160
- Sir, order for Captain Mayank--
- No!

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.680
Not yet.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.640
The doctor maybe phoney,

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.520
but the medicine is not.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.760
Made in India.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.120
Hurry up.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.640
He is from the army?

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.880
I've lost the major.
Send the team in.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.080
No, no, don't cut the feed, captain.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.000
For God's sake,
can I get another feed, NOW?

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.840
Keep the team ready for extraction.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:28.880
Sir.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.280
Team, be in position for extraction.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.680
Now, even you have to admit.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.200
God is on our side.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.080
Will somebody get me a feed now?

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.120
Trying to connect, Sir.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.960
We don't have
the whole day here, do we?

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.400
Hello.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.680
Sir, target recovered.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.840
Ask the team to come
to the extraction point.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:23.880
Abhi?

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.280
The team has already been sent.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.320
Iliyas Kashmiri is still alive, right?

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.520
Abhi, listen to me very carefully.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.600
We need Iliyas alive under
all circumstances.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.880
He has critical information.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.480
Please follow protocol...

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.600
Shit!

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.880
...then the consequences will be death.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.040
Is this you?

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.400
Would you prefer a slow death
or an instant one?

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.080
Major Abhimanyu Kanwar.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.320
Service Officer
in the 11th Gurkha Regiment.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.200
Under the Armed Forces
Tribunal Act 2007,

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.840
based on your own confession,

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.120
for the crimes that include section 3A.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.960
Dereliction of Duty,
not adhering to clear orders.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.200
Section 7A.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.480
Sabotaging mission and purpose.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.280
This summary general court orders

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.200
for your immediate court martial.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.000
You will not use this uniform
or rank here on under any circumstances.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:03.720
Your pension is revoked,
and you're ordered,

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.680
to submit your service
weapon immediately.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.680
For any such responsibility,

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.800
a criminal proceeding can be filed
against you at a civilian level.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.440
"My yearning heart."

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:23.760
"Seeks your memories."

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:31.640
"I paid the price,"

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.960
"With my tears."

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:43.400
"Your fragrance dwells in my breaths."

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:50.680
"How can I lose your sensation?"

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.400
"I am trying to"

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.040
"Make my love"

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:03.680
"Successful."

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.600
"I have kept you safe"

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.440
"In the abode of my heart."

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.560
"And I am going"

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.800
"To fight with storms."

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:42.680
"I have made your resolutions mine."

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:48.040
"Your promises are my breaths."

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.720
"The promises that remained unfulfilled."

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.440
"I am praying for its fulfilment."

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:05.640
"Your fragrance dwells in my breaths."

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:13.000
"How can I lose your sensation?"

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.240
Wasn't I clear?

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.000
Why are you here?

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.720
I made a promise.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.960
I've come up with something for you.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.400
The college is run
by the Village Council.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.320
I will speak to them for you.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.560
We're supposed to meet the
Pradhan (Chief) tomorrow.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.840
Take his blessings and start work.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:54.880
This is Barmer.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.760
Your attitude will get you nowhere.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.240
Did you understand anything?

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.040
Did you hear what I said?

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.960
This soil boasts of the blood
of our ancestors.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.760
Not sure about the blood of ancestors.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.800
But this is definitely fresh blood.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.280
Headmaster.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.760
How are you?

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.360
What pandora's box have you opened?

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.280
Who will clean it up now?

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.680
Who is he?

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.960
Sir. Sir.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.520
Greetings, sir.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.360
I heard you found a body.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.720
I hope it's not my daughter's...

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:03.880
Relax.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.720
The storm hasn't arrived yet,
and you're already running for cover.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.160
What if you can't stomach it?

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.400
You know my daughter's case, right?

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.000
She is missing.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.280
Missing?!

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.400
This is a case of kidnapping!

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.680
But no one is going
to name the culprit.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.320
Come with me. Order some tea
and a plate of snacks.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.160
Come on.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.640
Are you out of your mind?

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.320
She is lost. We will find her.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.960
- This isn't right, Meena sir.
- Your tea.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.840
Your deeds have probably
reached Pradhanji.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.680
You don't have to get involved
in civilian matters.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.120
Here, the judge,
jury and executioner

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.640
is the Pradhan (Chief).

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.560
Classes are conducted
in every corner of the district.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.320
The Chief.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.240
To educate our farmer brothers,

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.760
I've organised several such programs.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.520
Jitendar Pratap Singh.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.200
He's the Chief of 150 villages
in this district.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.480
Show some respect
when you address him.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.680
Or better yet,
you leave the talking to me.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.280
Come on.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.480
Sir. First, you set up solar panels.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.400
After that,
you started water harvesting.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.360
Now, what is this new interest?

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.960
It's called organic farming.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.600
Broccoli, baby corn, cherry tomato.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.600
For the progress of our district,

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.520
we must take the first step.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.880
- Isn't that, right?
- Yes, sir.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.680
- Come, Faizal.
- Yes, sir.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.120
- Cut.
- Come on, this way.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.240
Come on.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.320
Yes

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.480
You must have received an update from

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.720
the committee
at the Bindh district of Haryana.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.720
They propose to dismiss surnames

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.160
and instead, adopt the name
of the district or village.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.200
This will help in abolishing
the caste system...

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.840
and everyone
will be perceived as equals.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.960
What is your opinion?

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.960
It is a progressive proposal.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.880
In that case, swords, knives,

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.360
and blades will all be
considered razors.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.880
My uncle used to say,

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:23.880
"If we dress up a cat and a tiger
in the same skin,

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.760
"it doesn't make them equal.".

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.160
As I said, it's a good proposal.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.640
It should be discussed.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.760
Sir.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.400
I heard some rumours.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.480
Thought I should confirm with you first.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.200
The police have recovered a dead body,

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.040
- from a suitcase.
- Yes.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.080
The police have my full support.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:49.960
Yes.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.400
In fact, in a shameful act such as this,

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.520
if even my own brother
is suspected of being involved,

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.080
they can arrest him.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.480
I demand a neutral investigation.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.200
Can I take this on record, sir?

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.440
Make it tomorrow's headline!

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.480
Thank you.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.320
He is my son-in-law.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.360
I had spoken to you

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.560
- about the post of boxing assistant.
- Ahh, yes.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.320
He has also been
a state-level gold medallist.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.400
Fantastic.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.080
Can he only defend or attack as well?

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.640
I think all he can do is stare.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.960
I don't eat sweet.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.880
Shivani, send the children to school.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.960
Buddy...

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.760
Never say no to offerings.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.480
I don't believe in Him.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.320
Whom do you believe in?

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:02.440
A true atheist says too little,

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.440
or stays silent.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.240
This statement was made
by Charles Darwin.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.880
Now, it makes sense.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.560
Give him the job.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.320
I'm grateful, sir.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.880
No need to be grateful.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.800
I am not doing it for your sake.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.840
Every Navratri, our family

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.680
organises a religious gathering
to worship women.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.840
And I've been keeping
the tradition alive

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.800
for the past 15 years since
my father passed away.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.000
She would sit on that chair.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.520
While I sat on the ground.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.760
I'd wash her feet with my own hands,

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.280
and say...

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.080
"Need your blessings
to uphold our honour and respect."

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:55.240
She would smile and say, "Amen".

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.120
She wasn't Uttamlal's daughter alone.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.200
She was the daughter
of the entire village

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.120
My little sister.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.400
What I am doing,
I'm doing for Rashi.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.040
Give him the job.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.960
He could come in handy.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.200
Definition of, state in,

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.640
International law.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.640
It's a common exam question.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.160
Memorize the chapter thoroughly.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.280
What's wrong?

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.760
Sorry.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.720
Just wait.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.680
How much for the...

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.800
- 1300! Too high.
- 1300! Too high.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.720
Reduce the price.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.640
- Sir.
- Yes.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.400
Student.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.600
Line up at the desk, everyone.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.960
How many skipping ropes?

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.160
We have 15 or 16 skipping ropes.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.560
How much?
What's written here?

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.880
499?

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.360
- Unbelievable. 499?
- I'll give you a better price.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.800
Not done, son.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.000
All this is for the college.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.720
Don't give me these elaborate rates.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.040
I want a 30% discount.
And where are the dumbbells?

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.400
This?

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.360
Show me the bill.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.800
3 and will receive more by evening.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.680
I need the proper bill.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.000
Or I won't approve it.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.040
- I want them in two days.
- Okay, sir.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.040
No delays, okay.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.040
Come, Major.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.880
Okay then, Barmer Regiment, Attention!

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.200
I am Sunil Mahajan.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.120
Mountbatten.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.320
Your coach.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.400
That's Major.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.760
Your assistant couch.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.360
Name, college ID, height, weight.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.840
I want all these details.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:40.840
Understood?

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.640
Your boxing training starts tomorrow.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.960
I need all the information
in this register before that.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.880
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.840
Sir! Welcome.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.640
Should have sent word.
I would have showed up.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.800
Please.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.560
Major, get that chair.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.440
So these are the boys?

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.840
Yes. We are just making a list.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.240
Come, sir.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.640
Sit.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.480
- Let's begin.
- Of course. Hold on.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.600
Boys, state your name one by one.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.960
- Vikram Singh!
- Vishal Chauhan!

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.360
Vijay Khandelwal.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.520
Mann Singh.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.240
- Anwar Bhasin.
- Amar Singh.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.360
Vedaa Bairwa.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.560
Get your college IDs tomorrow...

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.040
BAIRWA!

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.000
You want to learn boxing?

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.520
Yes.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.600
With your permission?

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.560
Along with boys from the community?

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.240
Want to be a fighter?

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.160
- Sir, I can throw her out if you want...
- No!

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.400
Let her do her job.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.800
Over there.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.240
Bucket and mop.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.320
Come on.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.840
- Yes.
- Hurry up. Come on.

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.120
I'll film a video.

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.160
The girl should shine,

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.960
with her face as clear as glass.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.280
Sir, how would you like
to proceed with the training?

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.760
Nothing much.

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.320
I heard you'll be
putting new mattresses.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.720
We will warm them up, that's all!

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.640
Sorry. Slip of tongue.

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.360
Not at all.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.080
What are you doing?

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.520
Don't be crazy.

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.640
Dustied it up.

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.560
Sorry. It slipped!

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.480
- What is this?
- Careful, Major.

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.360
Are you okay, sir?

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.760
Coach sir, my...

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.600
We'll talk tomorrow, kid.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.280
- Tomorrow.
- Sir.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.400
Get ready.
We'll be doing a demonstration.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.720
Hurry up.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.600
Major. Keep this one in the cupboard.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.760
The coach should have one as well.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.720
- Sir.
- Yes.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.680
My kit?

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.040
Move off.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.600
Think about getting married, child.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.160
Don't waste your money.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.480
Go on. Come on.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.160
- Leave.
- Come on, Major.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.080
Everyone... Listen carefully.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.880
I won't repeat myself.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.800
Five punches in boxing are essential.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.000
You must learn them!

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.280
Come, sir.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.080
Let's give the boys a demonstration.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.160
Come.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.840
Now, boys.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.240
The first punch is a "Jab".

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.960
Get in the boxing stance.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.560
This is a "Jab".

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.360
This is "Cross."

00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.840
This is "Uppercut"

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.040
This is "Body Shots"

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.160
This is "Hook."

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.960
Hey... Didn't you understand?

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.360
I did, sir. I completely understood!

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.240
This is a jab, a cross,

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:17.320
an uppercut, a hook...
and a body shot.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.960
- Don't listen, do you?
- Please, sir.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.560
Let me deal with her, please.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.560
You focus on the training.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.560
I will talk to her.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.360
Kid, this is an expensive game.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.560
Go home. Go on.

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.280
Come on.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.000
Go away.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.160
Forget her.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.000
Guard up. Get into stance.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.120
Listen to me.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.080
Did you have dinner?

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.240
Yes.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.840
Vegetable curry.

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.280
Mom made bread and lentils.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.120
Keep some for me.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.040
Where did you get
this expensive phone from?

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.640
Dad, I...

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.600
Where did you get
this expensive phone from?

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:11.640
Wait.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.400
- Come on.
- Dad.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.200
Get out.
Get out.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.960
- Get out of this house.
- Listen to me.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.200
Get out.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.200
- Dad.
- Get out.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.800
- Dad.
- Get out.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.280
- Dad.
- Get out.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.440
Be quiet.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.480
All of you stay quiet.
No one will interfere today.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.560
Dad.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.840
Get out.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.680
I said we don't need you.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.160
Get out. Get out.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.080
You should be grateful.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.040
Be grateful the Baithak
(Village Council) doesn't know.

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.640
It's Khandelwal's daughter

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.040
this idiot is romancing.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:50.680
Dad, it's not...

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.120
Quiet. Shut up!

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.960
They will chop you up
and throw you in the river.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.400
No one will come to your help.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.360
You are a Bairwa's son.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.520
And that's your reality.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.720
I made a mistake, father.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.720
Forget her.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.840
Look, son.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.680
You cannot pluck a star

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.960
with your hand, son.

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.600
Forget her.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.960
Forget that girl.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.040
Father, have some pickles.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.120
I don't want it.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.600
It's really delicious. At least try it.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.680
But I don't want it...

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.000
Sorry, father. I'll take some.

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.480
How is it?

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.400
Nice.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.120
I washed it, dried it, peeled it,
grounded it and kept it to soak!

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.080
Come to the point.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.640
Stop beating around the bush.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.960
Come to the point.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.840
I want... Boxing kit, shoes... 20,000!

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.160
What for, Vedaa?

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.000
You've haven't even knitted
a sweater yet.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.960
You and your ever-changing hobbies.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.680
Can you get it for 12,000?

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.000
Absolutely, father.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.200
We can buy the shoes another time.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.040
Fine.

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.040
After dinner, we'll go to the ATM.

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.400
Okay. Thank you, father.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.200
5,6,7

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.760
Vedu. Will you be able to learn it?

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.520
Absolutely.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.280
And what if the Chief's brother
and his friends misbehave with us?

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.840
No chance.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.640
We'll beat them up!

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.080
What's the payment amount?

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.200
5,6,7,8,9

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.800
Vedu. Listen.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.640
Keep this as well.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:34.560
But, sister, you won this money
at the Maths Olympiad.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.080
So what?

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.040
Now they will help you win, Vedaa.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.600
But you have to become...

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.560
My fighter Vedaa.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.440
Fighter Vedaa.

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.640
Listen...record it.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.880
I'm recording.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.440
Here comes the student.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.360
Careful. You knocked her down.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.120
She came into the middle.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.600
Pick her up.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.840
Move her away.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.680
Careful... Look.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.960
Careful. Careful.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.520
She is hurt.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.440
Such rule-breakers all of you are!

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.880
Let her breathe.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.320
Get some fresh air.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.440
Move aside.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.000
This is irritating, move it aside.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.560
Listen.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.800
So you want to learn boxing, is it?

00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.840
Let me teach you.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.600
Sunehre, what were those
five types of punches?

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.960
Sir, they were... Jab.

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.760
Cross.

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:10.120
Then uppercut.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.280
And then hook and body shot.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.480
Right.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.360
Look at the little girl's reflexes!

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.640
I had said...

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.080
Remember your stature.

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:49.280
- There is some jaggery in that box.
- I don't like sweets.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.320
Don't like it?

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.840
What do you like then?

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:53.960
Do you drink blood?

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.600
I am a vegetarian.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.640
What are you even doing here?

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:01.720
I was thinking the same thing...

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.760
What a nuisance.

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:05.880
Where are you going?

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:16.440
Why fuss over it

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.800
Amidst the chaos

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.400
You were sound asleep

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.440
What's up, spill it out

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.760
What did you

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.080
do last night

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.080
What was your love upto

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.720
Why the fuss

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.200
Why the fuss

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.000
Where should I go now

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.360
Whose door should I knock

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.840
Whom should I tell my tale

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.960
Help me out

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.400
Where should I go now

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.680
Whose door should I knock

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.000
Whom should I tell my tale

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.200
Help me out

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.760
There is curfew at my home

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.960
what's causing him the stress

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:00.680
Why the fuss

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.200
Help me out

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.360
My love is lazy

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.600
It's all ruined

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.040
My love slept last night

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.320
Help me out

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.680
It's all ruined

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.880
Help me out

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.360
My love slept last night

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.720
Help me out

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.240
Simple little guy

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.440
has turned into a fool for you

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.720
He's been unhappy,
since you became his wife

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.080
The town is buzzing

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.240
About your wife

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:33.200
Amidst the chaos

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.840
You were sound asleep

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.200
What did you do last night

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.480
Spill it out

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.560
What was your love upto

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:45.040
Don't hide anymore

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.520
Don't hide anymore

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.080
Amidst the chaos

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.800
Mom out shopping

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.960
we were alone at home

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.480
I thought he'd say

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.720
come, let's play

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.080
In laws out shopping

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.400
we were alone at home

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.720
I thought he'd say

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.200
come, let's play

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.640
He's cozy under the blanket

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.000
I expected a tussle

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.320
Wasted all the time

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.480
As mom returned back

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.720
My love is lazy

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.880
It's all ruined

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.360
My love slept last night

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.760
Help me out

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.000
Lets go get chammo

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.080
Ready.

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.840
I'm going to enjoy tonight!!!

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.680
What's happening behind the door?

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.720
Where is she?

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.200
Where is Chammo?

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.720
Why did you use to stick so closely to her?

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.360
Don't worry. I'm here with you.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.160
Where is she

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:17.600
Go with Mary!!!!

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.600
Turn it off!

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.400
Raj Kishore.

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:28.200
Turn it off!

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:32.040
Turn it off!

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.880
At least lock the door,
for God's sake.

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:52.960
Hey.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.400
Who is there?

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.520
Sunhere. Open.

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.520
- Help!
- Who the hell is there?!

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.240
Your god damn father!

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.520
Open the door. I will show you.

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.160
About me.

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:20.240
Catch him.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.520
Rascal.

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:33.800
Anybody there?

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:34.880
Shut up.

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:42.280
- Sunhere.
- Sir. Coming, sir.

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.480
Open the door.
Go see who is that.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.560
Sir. Sir.

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:47.480
I can't get it opened.

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.560
Go check who that rascal is.
Make a video of that rascal.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.880
Go.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:31.680
Why you...

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.640
Why you...

00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:02.000
Don't let him escape.

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.480
Hey, stop!

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.520
Surrendering to you.

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.640
You dare to mess with me, huh?

00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.320
I'll make your grave right now.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.240
Hey!

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.160
Wait.

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.280
Who was that?

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.240
Who was that?

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:42.040
Where did he go?
Turn on the lights.

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.280
Where did he go?!

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:44.360
Hey.

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:47.880
I recorded everything.

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.520
Did you find out who he was?

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:03.720
Who?

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.600
If I wasn't locked inside the room,

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.440
he would be lying unconscious over here.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.200
You tell me.

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.840
His face was covered, sir.

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:13.160
We took a statement of the dancers.

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:14.560
But no one saw anything.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.560
This is weird.

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.600
Back in the day, when we killed,

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.560
people would say they saw nothing.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.640
Now we are getting beaten up,

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:28.600
and even the dancers claim
they didn't see anything.

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.880
After nurturing it for generations,

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:35.160
the seeds of fear we instilled have
grown into a bountiful tree.

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.200
But you idiots.

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:40.080
You can't even maintain it!

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:43.280
Who from Barmer could take on
our whole gang?

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.000
What if he's not from Barmer?

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:51.360
Get me details of the soldier.

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.400
Yes, sir.

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.960
It was a tough fight, sister.

00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:00.040
Coach sir said, "Upper...cut".

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.160
And I punched with all my strength!

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:05.440
And he got knocked out.

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.360
Vedaa.

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.160
You are a fighter...

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.160
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Please, sister.

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:13.440
Sorry. Sorry.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.560
Okay.

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.240
What was I saying?

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.240
That even I am thinking
of taking up boxing.

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.360
Will I be able to do it?

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:23.600
What was that you said?

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:25.960
There are four types of punches. Right?

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.840
First is uppercut,

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.160
second is jab.

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.560
The third is toss...

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:37.600
- And the fourth is...
- Sister. It's not "toss". It's "cross".

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:39.520
Sorry!

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.000
How would I know?

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:44.240
You know, Vedaa.

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:45.840
You will be the first boxer

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.320
from the Bairwa family.

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:51.040
Imagine. All our cousins
will be scared of us!

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.440
You've done so much,
might as well teach me too?

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.200
Catch!

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.680
You'll need two more weeks
to walk straight.

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.600
I'm here for the next two years.

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.000
Are you going somewhere?

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.560
Can you jump?

00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:56.440
Greetings, sir.

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.080
Greetings, sir.

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.080
I apologise for the delay.
Please...

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:05.600
Would you like to say something?

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.040
Over here.

00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:09.160
He has an attitude.

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:10.480
Say something.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.160
- Sir.
- One photo.

00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.560
This way, sir.

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:18.280
Lo and behold,
Jitendar Pratap Boxing Ring.

00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:22.160
Vedaa where are you going?
She is out of her mind.

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:25.480
Sir, we bought these equipment
for training.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:26.800
This way, sir.

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.960
These are the 14 candidates
we have selected

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.640
for the boxing competition.

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.360
We'll have a demonstration
for you after the inspection.

00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:35.440
Come on, boys. Get ready.

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:37.600
This is great, Principal sir.

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.280
The Holi party should be organized
in the college as well.

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.160
As you wish.

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:46.080
Let everyone in Barmer witness
this new gift from the Village Council.

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.440
As you wish, sir.

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:48.680
How are you?

00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:54.040
What is this?

00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:55.320
It's called a speed bag.

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:57.480
Will it test me too?

00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.640
One picture, Chief.

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.240
This is a pride moment.

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:05.240
This is the only boxing ring
in the entire area.

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:07.360
Boxers will receive the best training.

00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:11.320
- I believe this year my brother, Suyog,
- Not here. You will ruin everything.

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:12.360
Listen to me.

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:16.160
Suyog Singh will win the gold medal
in the boxing competition.

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.760
Every Navratri, your family holds
a religious gathering to worship women.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.120
The girls sit on the chair.
While you sit on the ground...

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:33.000
Wash their feet with your
own hands, and say...

00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:36.400
"Need your blessings to uphold
our honour and respect."

00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:38.360
They smile and say....

00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:39.720
Amen.

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.000
I told him this story.

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:44.960
Come to the point.

00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:48.000
He's given you his blessings.

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:49.520
Now ask for what you want?

00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:00.120
Sir...Sir...

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.000
- Speak up.
- I...

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.200
What is wrong? Speak up.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.400
If I could get permission to participate
in the boxing competition...

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.720
Aren't you Bairwa's daughter?

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.760
Do you want to compete?

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.080
Yes.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.480
Fantastic.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.040
Keep progressing
and pull your community out

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:43.080
from this pit of backwardness.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.520
- Mountbatten.
- Sir.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.040
- Take down her name.
- It will be done, sir.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.000
Give her all the facilities.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.160
Done, sir.

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.960
Fantastic.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:54.320
Yes, sir.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.520
- You must win!
- Yes, sir.

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.800
Thank you.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.320
Anything else I can do?

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.240
Okay. Bravo.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.240
Yes.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.000
- Come, sir.
- Chief.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.520
You were amazing.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.040
This is front page news.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.560
Come.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.400
The person in charge of cleaning
has already put on the uniform.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.840
This is from you.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.200
This one's from the junior chief.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.160
This from the chief.

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.240
Look over there.

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.680
Good God.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.200
The air's filled with colours in Holi,
tell the fiance

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.080
The air's filled with colours in Holi,
tell the fiance

My gait's full of attitude.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.760
My gait's full of mesmerising.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.320
Here comes the festival of colours.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.840

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.120
Lets fly in colours

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.160
forget all your senses
and dance in the presence of bhang

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.000
I don't need any permission

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:25.880
I hesitate in holi season

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.400
today with my will I will eat
all days of struggle

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:33.200
Or the world is like a monkey,
it is ginger, and make money, spend money

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.960
Shy people would show their shame

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.800
lets light the dance floor on fire

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.640
get parkour time energy on the dance floor

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.640
red, yellow green range all

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.480
no one is bad, one mus be adamant

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.240
Gulal flows in holi

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.200
The noise is up to Bombay

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.760
My heart's taken a leap

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:53.000
I sway without a care.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.320
I sway without a care.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:58.200

The air's filled with colours in Holi

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.840
I sway without a care.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.640
without a care.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.400
Colours in the air...

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.240
Colours in the air...

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.240
Colours in the air...

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.160
Colours in the air...

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.120
Colours in the air...

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:16.040
Colours in the air...

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:16.960
Colours in the air...

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:17.800
Colours in the air...

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.480
My heart's taken a leap

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:22.720
I sway without a care.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.880
I sway without a care.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.720
The air's filled with colours in Holi

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.120
tell the neighbourhood

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.120
TTo the neighbourhood.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:33.680
Colours in the air...

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.640
Colours in the air...

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:35.480

Colours in the air...

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.760
Bravo.

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.360
Great going.
They look so great together, eh?

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.640
Come on.

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.120
Uttamlal.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.080
The college has become a lover's point!

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:33.240
Look at this. Bairwa's son
and Khandelwal's daughter.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.200
Right under your nose!

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.880
The boy is not from our college, sir.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.200
But his sisters are.
They must have brought him in.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.040
Bairwa.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.600
Yes... Sir.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.440
How long have you been living
in this village?

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.560
I was born here, sir.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I am asking how many years?

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.440
Fifty... Fifty five years.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.240
What did you not understand
in these fifty-five years?

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:01.760
My boy crossed the line, sir.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.440
He made a mistake.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.000
Even we can make mistakes.

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.080
Let's chop him into pieces.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.280
- Bring my blade.
- Bring the blade...

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:09.560
No one's going to do anything!

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:15.880
Savages all of you.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:18.880
This is a civil matter.

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.200
We'll deal with it
in a civilised manner.

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.160
Let me refresh your minds again.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
My name, Jitendar Pratap Singh.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.040
I'm the Chief of 150 village
councils in Barmer.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.720
I was chosen by you.

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:45.760
Even I respect the untouchable
and caste system.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:48.400
Why you ask?

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.680
Why?

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.040
Because I didn't make this law.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.000
These arrangements were made in heaven.

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.080
You and I are nobody to change them.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.400
Since what you did was a sin,

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.000
you deserve to be punished.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.160
Son...

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.240
Walk up to the girl.

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:25.440
You too.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.400
Get on your knees.

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:42.680
Bow down.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.960
Rub your nose.

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:28.120
Are you thinking about something?

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.000
Hmmm...

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:33.400
What?

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.120
Vedu.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.240
Tell me.

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.000
Why are Shudras from the feet?

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.080
Arrangement made in heaven,
like the Chief said.

01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:57.160
Sleep. It's pretty late.

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.240
Then why are we taught the law?

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.000
Why are we made
to swear by the constitution?

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.280
Why don't they simply explain
this arrangement instead?

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.440
It's all about power, Vedaa.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.640
Now sleep. It's late.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:39.480
Where is the girl?

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.000
- Which girl, sir?
- The girl...

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.280
Don't make a public spectacle here!

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.120
- Sorry, sorry.
- Where is the girl? Aarti?

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.640
Tell us or you will get in trouble.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:47.400
There is no one here.

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.480
- Bairwa sir.
- There is no one here.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.720
Is this what you have
taught your son?

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.400
Even after bringing shame to the village,
you still haven't learned your lesson.

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:56.040
Baniyas can't hide their money,
but you managed to hide an entire girl!

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.680
Your son has eloped with
the girl since last night.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:09:59.840
- Warrant!
- Papa!!

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.720
Oh!! This is a love letter.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.600
Bairwa sir,
the boy and girl have eloped.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.240
My dear mummy-papa.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.400
Take them along.

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.280
- Take them in custody.
- Leave.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.400
Keeping quiet won't help anyone.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:14.240
If they get their hands
on the boy before us,

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.760
then you two will be responsible
for your brother's death.

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.360
I'll handle it.

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:30.000
Bairwa.

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:32.680
Sir.

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.520
Will your boy marry her?

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.480
Will your boy marry her?

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.440
How can he marry her...

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:40.000
How many times have I said not
to talk when elders are speaking...

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.240
Call your brother.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.640
Sir... His phone is switched off...

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.280
Email. WhatsApp. Social media.

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.080
Anywhere?

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.560
Get in touch and ask him!

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.440
Will he marry her?

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.880
If he agrees,

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.800
then all is forgiven.

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.680
I will talk to the girl's family.

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.880
Yes.

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.360
But don't test me this time.

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.960
If he betrays her after marriage,
remember...

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.640
There is no dearth of trees
and ropes in Barmer.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:22.160
No, sir... He will never betray her.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.320
Let's go.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.960
Vinod's mother.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.240
My son's life is saved.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:43.120
His life is saved!

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:55.840
(Chant)

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.480
The Chief has invited me.
I have to go.

01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.120
I've made dinner for you.
Make sure you eat.

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.440
Is your phone on?

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.360
Just in case...

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:19.480
(Chant)

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.320
There won't be
any patrolling today, Meena.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.800
Move your car.

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.160
Back.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:34.120
This road is closed,
turn back.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:49.000
(Chant)

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:02.800
Sir.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:05.960
Sir.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.840
You two are looking so happy.

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:10.440
That's it, that's it.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.600
What can I even gift you two?

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:18.720
You already have each
other forever and ever. Right?

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:22.000
But you deserve a gift.

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.000
Slaughter them!

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.000
Sir?

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:40.560
Vinod. Vinod.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.160
The sisters are for you all
to share and enjoy.

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:46.040
Run, children. Run away.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:46.720
Run.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.520
This way.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.880
Don't let the girl's escape.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.080
Help us.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.360
- Open the door, please.
- Anybody there?!

01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.360
- Please open the door!
- Someone is there?

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.120
Please open the door!

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.360
- Help us, please.
- Please. I beg you!

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.680
Open the door. Please!!

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.000
Help us!

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:09.320
Help us, please.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.600
Help us, brother. Please.
Take both of us inside.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.760
No, no listen, listen...

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.720
Run, sister! Run!

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.080
- We found their veil
- We'll find them too.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.960
I think they went this way.

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:28.240
Let's go.

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.560
Give it over there.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:36.880
Over there, over there, yes, here.

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.160
Where did you go?
Look there.

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:46.800
Spread out. Tear them limb to limb.

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:47.960
As you say.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.160
Look there.

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.400
This way.

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:53.000
Leave the younger one for me.

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.160
We'll leave her for you.

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.840
We can't run, Vedaa.

01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.280
We can't run.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.040
There will be a photo shoot.

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.520
We will make you famous.

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.840
I want to live.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.720
Vedaa. I want to live.

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.640
You're a fighter, right, Vedaa?

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:14.840
Spread out.

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:18.000
Save me, Vedaa. Please.

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.240
Find her.

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:21.600
There is only one way left.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.040
What?

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.480
You run, I'll divert their attention.

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:28.840
- What? Meaning?
- Sister, only one of us can get out.

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.600
You run, I'll divert them.

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.360
Just promise me,

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.440
You won't turn around.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.320
Is that it, Vedaa?

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.640
Run and don't look back. Yes?

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.800
Bloody useless, you all.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.120
Look in the corner.

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.880
Yes, sister.

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.640
Run, sister.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:58.640
- Sister.
- There she is!

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.720
Run, Vedaa.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.480
Run, Vedaa.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:05.840
Find the young one.

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.680
Run and don't look back, Vedaa!

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:10.720
Run.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.040
Catch her.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.640
Run, Vedaa.
Remember our promise, Vedaa!

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:19.600
Catch her.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.400
Catch her.

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:24.240
Run, Vedaa. Our promise!

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.120
Go and get her.

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:29.480
Catch the other one.

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.040
Find the younger one.

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.960
And the bear looked angry.

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.640
The two rabbits were hiding.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.480
Where were they?
Where were they?

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:42.960
Yes.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.280
We got the older one, brother.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:45.880
Still hunting for the younger one.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:47.400
Don't let her escape.

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:48.800
She won't.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:52.760
And then the bear roared.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.880
My sister, my brother...
Their marriage...

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.320
Chief...

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:18.480
Sister...

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:20.960
Marriage...

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.960
The chief destroyed it.

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:28.120
The wedding...

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.560
Why are we going to the mansion?

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.320
No.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:45.840
No.

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:03.560
I called his regiment.

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:05.080
He was expelled from the force.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.520
Reason is still unknown.

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.240
I've left my number for his senior,

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.400
He will call back.

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:12.760
Can we talk?

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.120
Bring the chairs.

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.600
Sit.

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:36.880
If Uttam's daughter can be

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:39.680
Barmer's daughter...

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.760
Then why not Bairwa's daughter?

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:50.280
Of course she is. Education, skills,
community weddings...

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.440
Whatever Bairwas ask for,

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.200
I give it to them with folded hands.

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.360
But if they mar our social order
and honour,

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:00.680
even my own daughter

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:02.720
would be punished with death.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:11.320
Who are you?

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.440
You are not the head of
any legitimate council.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.480
Just the chief of
this self-made committee.

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:23.840
Who gave you the power to act God

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:27.800
and pronounce punishment?

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.960
I have been chosen
through proper protocol.

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:37.760
What are your qualifications?

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.280
That you're a high school graduate?

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.840
Or that you have five acres of land
with a personal toilet at home,

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.440
along with running water facility?

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:48.040
I am an engineer, boy.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:50.800
Electronics Communication.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.560
Polytechnic, Jaisalmer.

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.720
Land ownership, 250 acres.

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:55.760
Declared.

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.400
Of which I've leased 100 acres.

01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.040
The rest is free for farmers.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.480
Want to use the toilet?
Take a right when you exit.

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:03.000
I've built 25 cubicles
for the entire village.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:05.800
You...

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.960
You are going to talk
to me about punishment?

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.640
When you couldn't save your wife.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.080
His wife worked in Kashmir.

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.040
One day, the terrorists came...

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.520
...and chopped her head off.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.360
And what did you do?

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.440
This is Barmer.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:38.480
Here, people who are in the wrong

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:40.800
Place one hand of theirs on the head
and the other on the balls.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Get the girl.

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:46.200
Come here.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.760
Hey...

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.320
It was surely him the other day,
beating everyone up.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.280
If you wanted to fight,

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:00.840
then why did you bring her here?

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:02.240
Why didn't you run?

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.440
That is my nature.

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:05.560
First, I give diplomacy a chance.

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:08.600
Try solving problems through talks.

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:11.360
Then, my hands do the talking.

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.560
Aren't you afraid of dying?

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:28.280
Anyone who says
he's not afraid of dying

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:30.960
is either a liar...

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:34.480
or a Gorkha.

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:43.440
I can't tussle,
I can only fight wars.

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.400
You have two options.

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:51.000
Reconciliation...

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:53.560
Or war.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.520
One, two,

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:10.520
three, four... Five, six, seven...

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.080
Eight, nine,

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.680
ten.

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:17.840
That's it.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.840
As kids, when we competed
with a weaker opponent,

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.640
we would give them a ten-step lead.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.720
And would softly say...

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:33.040
"Run, scoundrel."

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:39.400
Run, scoundrel.

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:49.000
Amen!

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:30.120
Berwa uncle, come here.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.840
Abhimanyu has sent a message.

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.280
Vedaa is alive.

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.360
Brother, are you alright?
The police will...

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:56.880
- Scan every inch of the city.
- Yes...

01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:58.440
Surround it from all sides,

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:00.960
except for the police station.

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.080
Where's the girl?

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.560
Papa? Mummy?

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.760
They are still alive,

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
for you.

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:24.080
The items?

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:24.960
Yes.

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.600
Does she have any relatives
she can go to?

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:36.440
She has an uncle in Khejarla.

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:38.480
Take her there for her own sake.

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:42.840
I thought there were

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.040
three people leaving tonight
and not one.

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:46.600
Don't worry about me.

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:47.880
I have to.

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:49.480
I am obligated to.

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:51.080
Made a promise to her.

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:54.120
Tonight, think about her,
not the promise.

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:58.600
Sometimes, life gives you a chance
to keep those alive whom you've lost.

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.160
This girl's life
is now your responsibility.

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.800
You know that she would have said
the same if she was alive, right?

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:12.720
I wish she was.

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.520
So that I could ask her,

01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:16.720
why was she so persistent?

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.000
Because persistence yields fruition.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.080
Bloody hell.

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:24.160
Like father, like daughter.

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:26.360
You two don't be seen together.

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:30.520
And cross the state border
before dawn tomorrow.

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:31.840
Let's go.

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.520
How will they get to Khejarla?

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.480
On foot?

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.080
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.600
Just got a call from the Control Room.

01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:50.960
They've spotted an ambulance
driving via Baitu.

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.960
The ambulance belongs to Janta Hospital
which shut down five years ago.

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.800
- You go after them. I am coming.
- Yes, okay.

01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:57.520
Let's go. Faster.

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:24.680
Take this position.

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:56.360
Stop the car.

01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:58.080
Coach sir.

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.280
Coach sir...look...

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.440
Go after them. Don't lose sight.
Don't let them go.

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.680
Let's go. Let's go.

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:35.640
Can you drive?

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:37.640
- Do you know how to drive? Do you?!
- Yes, little bit.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:38.680
Very good.

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:39.720
Move. Come on.

01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:46.680
Why you...

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:16.040
Vedaa, brake!

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.080
Go.

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:47.560
Soldier.
Stop.

01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:57.440
Hey, soldier! He's lost his mind.

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:05.600
Make a video.

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.840
Got her. Got her.

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:14.560
Let's make a final video of the girl.

01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.200
Sit.

01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:25.160
Why are you crying?

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:28.480
Why are you crying?

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:31.040
Why are you crying?

01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:32.280
Why are you crying?

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.360
Don't cry.

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:37.360
Don't cry. Don't cry.
Don't cry.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.200
Don't cry.
Don't cry.

01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:41.360
Don't cry.

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:51.520
Who all were there with him?

01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:54.400
He was alone.

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:55.520
Huh?

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:56.880
He was alone.

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.160
One man!
Your police couldn't catch one man?

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:02.200
I'll deploy everyone from the cyber cell

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:05.360
to every check post in the district.

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:07.200
Don't worry, Chief.

01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:10.560
By morning, their dead bodies

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:13.200
will be lying at your feet.

01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:18.360
Look, I want them alive.

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:20.400
I will kill them.

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:24.240
When luck isn't in our favour,

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:29.080
we should strategise.

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:31.360
By hook or by crook,

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.800
try everything in your power, nephew.

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:36.280
This is your last chance.

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:37.760
Consider it done, uncle.

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.640
The entire district
of Barmer has been sealed off.

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:42.920
Our boys are at every highway,
every lane.

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:44.920
Yes, but they are not on the highway.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:48.760
Forget the highway.

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:50.120
And scan the dirt roads.

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.840
Bring more manpower.

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:56.800
Police officials, insurgents,
goons, animals,

01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:58.000
whatever you can get.

01:31:58.360 --> 01:31:59.520
Rope them in.

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:18.120
Why are you saving me?

01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:27.400
Why?

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:39.680
If we travel along Loni river,
we'll reach Khejarla.

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.760
But...

01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:46.360
There is no point going there.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.400
Meaning?

01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:51.840
Meaning...

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:55.360
All our relatives will be scared.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:00.280
If we never stood up for anyone...

01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:05.040
Why will anyone invite
trouble for our sake?

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:10.360
We have to go someplace.

01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:16.360
Court.

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.800
What's the point?

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.000
The case will drag on.

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.040
You will keep getting new dates.

01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:29.520
You will keep getting threats.

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.920
They may shoot you outside
the court itself.

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:34.840
What will you gain?

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:38.360
Hope.

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.040
I will get some hope.

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.400
Even you go on postings.

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:57.640
I never stop you from going.

01:33:57.720 --> 01:33:58.920
Then why are you stopping me?

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.480
Because this is not your job.

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:01.960
Meeting the Hurriyat as an author

01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.480
and passing information
to Intel is not your job.

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:05.760
Why can't it be?

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.600
And why do you get to decide that?

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:09.080
Rashi, you don't have to raise

01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.800
the revolutionary flag for everything.

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:12.160
What you're doing is dangerous,

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.040
and we've got professionals
to handle it.

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:15.640
Clearly, they can't.

01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:18.480
Which is why they've asked
for help from a civilian.

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:19.800
Can't believe this.

01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:21.840
What's the worst that can happen?

01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:23.520
I will lose.

01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:27.120
But at least I will go down fighting.

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.280
At least I would've tried!

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:29.920
- Rashi...
- Don't.

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.400
Never stop someone when

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.520
they are trying to do something good.

01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:38.560
Just say,
"Go ahead and try if you want to...

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:39.800
...I am with you."

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.560
As the saying goes,

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:47.120
"All one needs is another's hand,

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:48.960
then you're never alone."

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:16.360
Whether you know or not,

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:19.360
you're the one I am crazy about.

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:24.720
You are my love.

01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:28.600
I look for excuses,

01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:31.720
to be close to you.

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:36.560
Take a step towards me.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.960
Don't ask me

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:43.920
what the heart desires.

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:47.080
I just know

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:52.560
I can belong to no one else.

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:56.400
I didn't realise

01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:59.360
how attached I am to you.

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:04.680
This love will not lessen

01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:11.600
If I can't make you mine,

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:17.400
I'll see you again
in the next lifetime.

01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:23.920
I'll see you again
in the next lifetime.

01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:29.560
I'll see you again
in the next lifetime.

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.920
Uncle has a drinking habit.

01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:10.160
- Uncle?
- Vedaa!

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:12.240
God bless.

01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.680
Wasn't it Vinod's wedding today?

01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:17.840
They killed everyone, uncle.

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:19.840
Who killed everyone, my child?

01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:22.400
Are you going to ask all these questions
while pointing that gun at me?

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:47.440
Don't worry, child.

01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:50.800
We will leave for Jodhpur
in the morning.

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.760
We'll find an officer we know.

01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:57.760
We'll call your parents
from there. Okay?

01:38:58.120 --> 01:38:59.360
Army?

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:02.880
Assam Regiment.

01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:05.040
How did you know?

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:08.960
He was in the army too.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.200
Gorkha Regiment.

01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:15.120
Sorry, sir. I didn't realise.

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:16.400
I've been court-martialled.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.440
You're saving her life...

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:21.080
You seem like a good man to me.

01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:24.120
- Are you still in the army, or...
- Retired now, sir.

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.080
I got a government job, so...

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.960
I'll get some water.

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:54.280
Coach sir... Umm

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:09.840
Hey.

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:11.640
Stop. Shhhh.

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.360
Go on.

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:19.040
The deal was to give you information.

01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:20.400
Not to be your scapegoat.

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:22.560
Why should I go in?

01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:23.560
To get shot?

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:25.920
You will get shot anyway.

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.720
Think again.

01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:29.960
Go on.

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:31.880
Go.

01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:33.760
Rascal.

01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:44.040
Weapons down.

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:54.760
Weapons down.

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:01.680
Rascal shot me.
Have you all gone deaf?

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.720
Throw your guns down.

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:05.960
Throw it down.

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:07.240
Throw it!

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.200
So many medals hung on the wall,

01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:23.360
but not a single regiment badge.

01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:26.520
Who would know the meaning
of that better than me?

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:29.960
You were court-martialled.

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:35.400
What price did you put on me, uncle?

01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:38.680
10,000? 15,000?

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.880
The price would have surely been low,
since I'm lower caste.

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:45.000
It's my life in exchange for yours.

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:47.040
That's the price.

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:49.240
Who else knows we are here?

01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:57.080
Coach sir, he's my uncle!

01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.400
Who else knows we are here?

01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:01.280
Uncle...

01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:13.400
We've reached the tower.

01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:14.960
We're bringing in more force.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:23.840
Vedaa, run!

01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:45.040
Coach sir!

01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:58.920
Check ahead.

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:01.720
Come on.

01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:02.840
Spread around.

01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:06.240
Spread around.

01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:09.600
Keep checking.

01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:13.680
Look over there.

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:14.880
Check there.

01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:16.720
In that corner.

01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:17.840
Over there.

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:19.840
Go and check down there.

01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:21.440
Spread out.

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:24.440
Son-in-law, it has become dawn.

01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:26.400
Come out now.

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:29.720
- Breaking news of the hour!
- Keep following the sun, you'll find me.

01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:31.360
Your friend, that traitor Mountbatten.

01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:33.360
- You...
- Come quickly.

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:34.120
Come on.

01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:35.400
Look there...

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:38.080
Stop. Look there.

01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:39.440
Hurry up.

01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:40.720
Where will they escape?

01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:41.880
Where will they escape?

01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:45.240
Someone's over there.
Catch him.

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:51.400
Over here. Over here!

01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:33.280
Hey...catch that rascal.

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:35.480
Catch that girl.

01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:03.920
Vedaa.

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.400
Soldier.

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:25.040
I wish you had given up earlier,

01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:26.720
for your own good.

01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:28.800
Teach him a lesson now.

01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:31.240
I will handle the girl.

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.240
Her time has come.

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:35.960
Take care of him!

01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:51.920
Shut down your police stations, Purohit.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.200
I'm doing your jobs for you.

01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:58.200
Now hurry up over here
and write the report.

01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:00.240
Hurry up. Let's go.

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:19.960
Bloody idiots!
Can't do one job properly!

01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:10.640
Over there!

01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:29.640
Let's see you escape now!

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:32.360
Where will you go now?

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:02.520
Coach sir!

01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:07.160
Why you...

01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:22.520
Shoot him, Purohit.

01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:24.360
Don't let them escape.

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:40.920
Stop all this. Stop this drama.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.520
Barricade all exits.

01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:44.240
No one goes out!

01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:45.760
Where is the girl?

01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:47.240
Where is she?

01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:48.800
Out of my way. Where is she?

01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:50.400
Where is the girl?

01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:51.880
Attention. Attention.

01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:54.680
No need to be afraid.

01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:57.200
We are searching for a terrorist.

01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:00.960
A woman constable
will be checking the females.

01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:02.760
The men form a line, please.

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:04.800
Women and children on the other side.

01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:06.400
Come on.

01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:07.880
Chief, we are trying!

01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:09.240
Please don't make
things difficult for us.

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:10.280
Find them!

01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:12.520
We are doing our jobs, chief.

01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:15.000
Please cooperate with us.

01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:16.680
The police are here for you.

01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:19.000
We are only looking for a terrorist.

01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:21.400
The female constable will

01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:23.640
check all the women very carefully.

01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:26.960
Don't be afraid.

01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:28.880
We are on your side.

01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:31.000
Help us so we can protect you.

01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:32.760
Hold the line.

01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:36.400
The police are here for you.

01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:39.160
We are only looking for a terrorist.
Don't be afraid.

01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:41.000
We are on your side.

01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:44.400
Yes, this one.

01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:47.640
Do I have to tell you separately.
Stand over here.

01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:51.680
Son. Don't be scared.

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:53.360
The police are here
for your protection.

01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:54.760
The police is your friend.

01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:58.920
We are looking for a terrorist.

01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:01.480
I am telling them, priest.

01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:03.400
Yes, absolutely.

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:05.520
Constable, take him away.

01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:35.520
Vedaa.

01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:58.480
Father, I really tried to save Gehna...

01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:02.200
But I...

01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:11.520
Here's what you asked for.

01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:14.240
A timetable of the trains
that depart from here.

01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:18.040
First, decide where we go from here.

01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:19.920
That's why I have called you.

01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.480
Explain to her.

01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:24.560
Madam doesn't like relatives.

01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:25.600
What?

01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:29.360
Where will you go at
a time like this, child?

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:30.720
- Court.
- Huh?

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:32.200
Court.

01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:34.160
Which one? Do you even know?

01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:35.560
High Court.

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:37.240
628/4F2.

01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:38.600
Dangiyawas Bypass Road

01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:40.600
Working hours - morning 9 AM
to evening 5 PM.

01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:42.120
And what will the court do?

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.840
Article 46 and 22!

01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:47.480
We can invoke a three-member bench.

01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:50.400
Under section 231A,
an FIR is not required.

01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:53.520
Dalit Rights, Section 129 is applicable.

01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:56.520
You have taught me law, father. Right?

01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:58.360
I did.

01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:03.280
And now I, myself,
will introduce you to reality.

01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:07.600
You can achieve nothing on your own.

01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:11.200
I have a friend in Cuttack.

01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:12.840
I've spoken to him.

01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:15.040
You go there.

01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.480
Go there, and if by chance,
they find you...

01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:48.440
So that those upper caste vultures
don't get their hands on his daughter,

01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:52.480
A father is handing a blade to her.

01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:54.400
And you...

01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:57.360
were ranting about relatives.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.640
Enough, father.

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:16.200
We've forgotten to breathe.

01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:18.760
I know the ways of the world, child.

01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:20.920
Do what you want,

01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:25.400
but you're destined
to lose this battle.

01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:26.880
Even if I lose,

01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:28.960
I want to go down fighting!

01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:32.040
Even if I lose,
I will go down fighting.

01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:52.600
If I lose,

01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:55.840
your blade will come in use.

01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:15.400
Hello.

01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:16.840
Hello.

01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:18.760
Hello!

01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:20.640
Hello.

01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:22.680
Can you hear me, brother?

01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:23.600
Hello.

01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:25.400
Yes, he's right here.

01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:28.160
Come and light his pyre.

01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:29.480
Hello.

01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:31.480
I'm sending you the location.

01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:34.040
- Send our location to my brother.
- Yes sir.

01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:37.720
Until then, let's have a final round with
Ms. Heavy Weight Champion here.

01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:47.600
Even with the hair gone,

01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:49.360
you look tasteful.

01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:51.480
Truly amazing.

01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:53.200
Right, soldier?!

01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:57.360
No, no, no.
Don't make that mistake.

01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:07.640
Brother.

01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:11.880
I will kill you using your own methods.

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:15.640
Hey...

01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:16.680
Look at me.

01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:18.760
Look at me.

01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:20.400
Look at me!

01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:24.560
Gehna wasn't listening to us,
just like this.

01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:30.040
We kept telling her to stop, stop.

01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:33.480
But no, she jumped into the water.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.480
She was all wet.
We had to dry her.

01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:40.400
We always have cans of petrol
lying in the car.

01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:43.480
And a lighter in the dashboard.

01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:51.360
Doused her. Doused her. Doused her.

01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:53.920
And boom...

01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:56.960
Burnt her alive.

01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:03.600
I've thought of a special
scheme for you.

01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:08.680
You have a feisty tongue, right?
Come on, now open your mouth.

01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:10.280
Open your mouth.

01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:14.120
Open up...

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.520
Why you...

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:05.840
Forgive me.
Forgive me, soldier.

01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:06.840
Forgive me.

01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:16.680
In boxing,

01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:20.280
there are five types of punches.

01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:21.400
Remember?

01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:23.920
Or do I have to remind you?

01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:31.720
Come on, make a video now.

01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:37.160
First is jab.

01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:39.600
Second is cross.

01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:41.920
Third is hook.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:42.840
Sister.

01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:44.960
Fourth is body-shot.

01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:50.080
You're still the bloody sole of my shoe!

01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:54.240
I am not a shoe...

01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:57.000
I am an unbreakable weapon, chief.

01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:01.800
Oh, oh, oh! I forgot the last one.

01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:08.520
This is the uppercut.

01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:12.360
Hey...

01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:34.720
You enjoy burning people alive,
right, chief?

01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:38.760
So just for you,
I have a super special scheme.

01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:42.640
Just stay conscious.

01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:50.800
I will need your help.

01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:53.640
Before or after reaching the court?

02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:11.800
- Where is here?
- This is the location he gave us.

02:00:11.880 --> 02:00:13.080
Suyog?

02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:20.440
Pick up.

02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:23.920
Over there.

02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:30.360
Suyog?

02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:33.440
Suyog?!

02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:17.840
NOOOOOO.....

02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:58.200
Our ancestors are here.

02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:02.440
They've come to bless us.

02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:06.840
Now, you will rewrite their destiny.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.560
We will blow the final trumpet
of this war.

02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:12.480
Open all the roads.

02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:18.240
Now we'll prepare
a trap for Abhimanyu.

02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:23.680
We will blow the final trumpet
of this war.

02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:27.400
Run, nephew.

02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:32.120
Move forward.

02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:36.920
Don't let the girl reach the judge.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:38.800
Come on.

02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:40.400
Shoot her.

02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:46.400
- Where did they go?
- Uncle that way.

02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:47.680
Check that way.

02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:56.000
- Where is the judge?
- Don't know.

02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:58.080
- Where is the judge?
- Don't know.

02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:11.440
Good morning, soldier.

02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:14.160
Shoot, soldier.

02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:15.840
He's right in front.

02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:22.400
Shoot anyone you see.

02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:28.400
Yes, yes, relax.

02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:35.120
Vedaa, you'll have
to go ahead on your own.

02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:36.960
And you?

02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:38.160
Don't worry about me.

02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:41.600
No, no, Coach sir. I cannot...

02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:42.880
Vedaa.

02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:47.400
Do you know why Gehna chose
you instead of herself?

02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:50.440
Because she knew you alone could win.

02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:55.000
Don't shatter her faith.

02:04:57.440 --> 02:04:59.480
Shoot the man not the wall.

02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:03.880
The soldier's time has come.

02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:12.160
Vedaa, run.

02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:21.640
Got him.

02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:23.960
Coach sir!

02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:30.840
Come on, Vedaa.

02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:32.400
Listen, Vedaa.

02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:33.760
Go, Vedaa.

02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:36.760
Let's go, Vedaa.

02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:43.000
The soldier is down, uncle.

02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:45.920
Let's put an end to his story, nephew.

02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:54.000
Throw a grenade.

02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:55.120
Come here.

02:05:55.760 --> 02:05:57.480
Guard here.
Get the gun.

02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:30.800
Let's go.

02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:47.040
Uncle, go after the girl.

02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:50.960
I will join you after
giving this soldier his final medal.

02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:54.000
Come on.

02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:00.720
Soldier.

02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:06.720
Hey, Soldier.

02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:51.000
Judge sir.

02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:53.400
Judge sir, listen to me.
Open up. Listen to me.

02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:01.720
Open up.

02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:02.920
- Judge sir.
- Open the door.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.280
For God's sake open the door.

02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:05.800
Listen to me.

02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:40.360
Meghwal!!

02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:59.000
One who feeds you,

02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:01.960
you must be loyal to him.

02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:04.400
Little one...

02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:08.160
You like to fly, don't you?

02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:12.720
I will clip your wings.

02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:18.880
Run away.

02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:20.680
Run, child.

02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:24.600
Trying to save your father, are you?

02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:04.520
You are bleeding so much.

02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:07.680
Forget this, Coach sir.

02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:08.880
Let's go to the hospital first.

02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:10.080
I don't want to go now.

02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:13.480
Did you forget your training?

02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:16.000
When you are so close to winning,

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.080
you cannot back down.

02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:19.400
Please, Coach sir...

02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:22.400
Time for the knockout punch.

02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:26.840
Go, Vedaa.

02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:28.160
No, Coach sir...

02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:31.200
Go.

02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:34.720
Come on.

02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:37.800
Careful.

02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:48.960
Soldier!

02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:00.560
Hey, soldier!

02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:25.600
I said I will get you till here.

02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:28.880
No, Coach sir...

02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:51.920
Do not break my trust, Vedaa.

02:11:55.880 --> 02:11:57.240
Coach sir...

02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:24.360
Hey, soldier!

02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:29.160
My name is Vedaa Bairwa.

02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:31.640
I come from a low caste.

02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:34.920
My family was tortured,
my brother...

02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:37.680
My brother, Vinod Bairwa

02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:40.880
and sister, Gehna Bairwa
were brutally murdered.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.560
And the administration did not help us.

02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:48.360
I request you under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India,

02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:52.720
and section 482 of CrPC

02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:54.640
that my case should go to trial.

02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:57.040
I simply want you to listen...

02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:03.360
Don't break the trust, Vedaa.

02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:05.560
Don't break the trust.

02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:15.600
What?

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:21.120
What?

02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:31.280
I had told you.

02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:34.360
I'll give you a 10-step lead.

02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:36.800
No one will listen to her.

02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:41.360
There will be no trial or judgment.

02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:44.160
Call the girl outside.

02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:47.440
These lectures yield no results.

02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:52.080
This is the law of creation!

02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:54.080
Nothing will change.

02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:59.120
Because it is
He who has made these laws.

02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:01.800
What can these bloody judges do?

02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:05.800
That's what they all say...

02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:08.520
Everyone says
what can the judge do?

02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:11.720
Papa, Coach sir,
Gehna, they all said that.

02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:15.080
I was stupid to trust you.

02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:18.440
Because this is not your fault,
it's mine...

02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:21.440
to be born a Dalit
and a woman on top of that...

02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:31.040
These people who won't even touch us,

02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:34.600
how will they let us live with dignity?

02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:41.200
And the people like you who can make
a difference to this social evil,

02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:44.920
are scared and locked up in a room.

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:52.240
Your parents didn't read
the Mahabharat, did they?

02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:56.520
If they had, they wouldn't have
named you Abhimanyu.

02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:00.720
Because Abhimanyu
gets trapped in the maze

02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:04.200
and cannot break out of it.

02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:18.240
Hey, soldier!

02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:24.840
Leave me.

02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:30.240
She hasn't finished speaking yet.

02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:36.560
I don't want much from you.

02:15:40.840 --> 02:15:42.480
Except for my rights!

02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:47.200
The right to live.

02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:50.000
The right to live with dignity.

02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:52.520
The right to live with respect.

02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:54.680
The right to breathe!

02:15:54.760 --> 02:15:57.680
Because I want to breathe.

02:15:58.520 --> 02:15:59.600
All I want to do is breathe,

02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:01.560
and all my sister wanted
to do was laugh,

02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:03.920
and all my brother wanted
to do was to be in love.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:07.280
We want to breathe.

02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:10.400
Just breathe.

02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:12.040
Let go.

02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:18.080
Please, someone, hear my case.

02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:22.640
Let go.

02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:25.520
Let go.

02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:30.560
Let go. Let go. Let go.
Let go. Let go.

02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:33.440
Let go. Let go. Let go.
Let go. Let go.

02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:37.080
Let go. Let go. Let go.
Let go. Let go.

02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:38.760
I will hear your case.

02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:51.000
Let go. Let go. Let go.
Let go. Let go.

02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:07.600
"Whenever virtue subsides

02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:15.520
and wickedness prevails

02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:22.280
I manifest myself

02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:29.400
to establish virtue and destroy evil."

02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:34.640
When evil oversteps its boundaries,

02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:39.440
I will manifest to protect righteousness.

02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:47.080
If you had read the Mahabharat properly,

02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:49.360
you would know,

02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:54.600
That a woman's wrath,
her disrespect,

02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:57.360
can topple an entire kingdom.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.760
I am just the charioteer.

02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:09.440
The real warrior is in there.

02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:13.920
She alone will break

02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:20.000
your fake law and order system.

02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:49.360
What did you get from all this?

02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:54.360
What I couldn't get from taking a life,

02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:57.920
I got from saving one.

02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:02.760
Peace.

02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:07.560
Now, I will give you salvation.

02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:39.360
Amen.
