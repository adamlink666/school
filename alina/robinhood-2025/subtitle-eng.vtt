00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.680
This thing is very good!

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.280
I have come a long way from Lanka

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.600
looking for land like this.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.480
This place produces gold.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.680
Hey, Varada. This village is mine from now on.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.040
My permission is mandatory for anyone who wants to leave or come.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.960
With God as my witness.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.800
Hello?

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.400
regards.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.320
The conditions at the orphanage were bad.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.840
Children…

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.680
not receiving proper food

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.400
due to this situation.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.600
Not here, look there.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.800
Mr. Murthy, please make sure the children are served properly.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.360
Make sure everyone eats their fill. Got it?

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.600
Eat well, my child.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.880
This news must be prominently featured.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.160
Greetings Kamalakar, generous food provider!

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.960
We cannot afford to pay for their daily needs.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.040
We don't have…

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.640
any sponsor.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.960
I took on these six academically gifted children through my company.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.600
You are a great man.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.160
Thank You.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.640
Mr. Murthy and the children from the orphanage are here.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.240
Did you send ₹ 10 lakh in cash?

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.880
-Yes, sir. -Send the cash. Send that person out.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.920
Okay, sir.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.200
We haven't received any help from you for a long time.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.120
If you could show us some mercy…

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.960
Why are humans like this?

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.280
A man deceived us with false promises about food.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.320
Another gave us false assurances about sponsorship.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.960
I believe he will really sponsor my studies.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.280
I hope to study well and get a good job,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.640
and supporting other children like us in their studies.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.320
Those who visit us here are nothing but thieves.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.600
They are just using us for their own benefit.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.600
No, man. You can't talk about our family members like that.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.280
"India is my country. All Indians are my brothers and sisters."

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.520
is a pledge we take every day. What does it mean?

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.720
This country is our family.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.400
Every citizen of this country is a member of our family.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.800
Relying on family when necessary is good, my friend.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.720
So, you all just want to study well. Is that it?

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.680
With the support of our family, I will educate you.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.880
But how?

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.280
-Dad. I want the balloon. -Why the balloon? It'll just pop.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.840
Food can also be digested, sir. Does that mean we stop eating?

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.040
Good logic, Dad. I really want this balloon.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.280
how many?

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.880
You are like my family, sir. You don't have to pay.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.040
Since you see me as family, give me another one.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.280
Go away.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.600
Didn't I warn you that the balloon would pop…!

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.480
Mr. Murthy, there's a remittance for you.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.680
to us?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.520
Hey, eat until you're full.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.360
Hello, Ram.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.200
I will join you in helping educate all our friends.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.400
Why deal with all this? Study hard.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.280
It's hard for me to learn, friend.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.800
What interests you?

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.640
-What do you want, dear? -Is Mr. Mahendra home, ma'am?

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.400
I need to deliver this package to him.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.200
I am his wife. You can give it to me.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.880
If you are his wife, who is the person in this photo?

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.400
Sister…

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.520
You gave ₹ 10 lakh in cash, right?

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.960
I heard him say he would give it to her.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.840
Who is he? Did you also give that ₹ 10 lakh to him?

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.560
Don't hit me. They're in the locker upstairs.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.200
High-profile home burglaries continue!

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.120
Who is Robin Hood who targets the rich,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.320
rob a lot, and commit robbery?

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.920
Someone is implementing his master plan and robbing the whole thing.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.680
and this TV channel is achieving its goals!

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.560
It may be a joke to you, but we're burning inside!

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.040
Sir! Your BP is rising. Please calm down.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.040
Those waiting outside are not here to mourn their own losses.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.720
They heard about the theft at my business partner Agarwal's house,

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.640
and came to comfort me.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.680
How important is it whose house is targeted between the two of us?

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.000
I feel ashamed to call myself the Minister of Home Affairs.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.200
I don't care what you do or who you get rid of!

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.560
The case needs to be solved. And the thief needs to be caught.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.880
Victor Varghese.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.840
Who's he?

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.840
Stray dogs.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.280
He just trusted his instincts.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.160
Zero unsolved cases.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.280
Consider the case closed, sir.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.280
Victor is on top of him.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.280
What happened?

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.240
We woke up at 5 am for Lakshmi pooja today.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.280
We want to keep gold in the pooja room,

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.160
We cut the CCTV feed to prevent security from seeing it.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.880
Out of nowhere, a man wearing an N-95 mask appeared, sir.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.680
He took off everything he could take.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.400
-What does he look like? -Pretty normal, sir.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.480
Listen, honey, he didn't ask about you.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.400
The man was six feet tall.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.880
He has a physique that is almost a six-pack.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.200
He looks very smart.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.240
What is this, honey?

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.600
Stop! We must tell the truth to the police and the doctors.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.280
Any clues about his body language?

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.520
Her eyes are classy,

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.600
and his body language screams mass!

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.120
I couldn't see his lips because of the mask,

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.640
-but from the way he walks... -Hey, pay attention to all this.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.920
Sir!

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.680
You need to catch him, sir!

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.920
What the hell is this?

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.000
The bicycle seen near Agarwal's house this morning

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.880
just found in Sona Bazaar, sir.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.200
I need information about the king.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.680
who handle the bulk illegal gold trade in this area immediately.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.280
Seth Chaman Lal is the head of that market.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.920
Sir, the agreement will not take effect there once we leave.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.160
After the robbery at Agarwal's house in the early hours of 5am,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.800
He now casually goes to Sona Bazaar.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.640
Do you understand his attitude, sir?

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.120
Set up an interrogation room.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.280
You have a dinner date with the thief tonight.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.120
Should I carry the bag, Seth?

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.560
Not today, Johnny.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.280
I suspect the police are approaching us.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.800
Policy?!

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.600
Don't take any chances, Johnny.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.600
The police are all around us. We don't know how many there are.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.480
Seth said don't bring a bag today.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.920
Hey!

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.560
They must be criminals. Move!

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.840
Open the door.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.720
Break the door.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.040
You said you don't know how many of them there are and where they are.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.920
13 members in total.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.520
They are on duty but clearly not on a diet.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.480
Their stomachs spilled out of their shirts.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.320
It will take them ten minutes to figure out that we are out of touch.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.800
That's a lot of time to not only exchange gold, but an entire store!

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.920
How did you know the police would be here?

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.320
Whether they come or not,

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.720
if we are prepared for their arrival,

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.160
There will be no problem even if they come.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.920
Something is happening here. Speak the truth, Chaman Lal.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.120
Sir, I am not Chaman Lal, I am Pyare Lal, Look at the institution itself.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.040
Hey! Who put Chaman Lal's name on my board?

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.920
Sir!

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.280
Sir.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.400
This guy plays the game too well.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.480
Now. I'll show him my game.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.720
-India. -Sir.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.680
I need all CCTV footage from this area immediately.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.600
Okay, sir.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.840
-Hello! -The interrogation room is ready.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.920
-Have you caught the thief? -You're trapped!

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.240
When the hunter makes a silly face, the deer deceives him.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:10.880
A small fish kicked a blind crane in the back.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.600
India is my country He used the back door for his entry

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.040
Breaking every lock in sight Cleaning out the safe overnight

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.360
With the balance of the Rich He plays PUBG!

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.840
The bridge between the slums & the mansions He stands firm, hot as fire

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.120
Go rob, rob, rob, Robinhood!

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.360
Go rob, rob, rob, Robinhood!

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.840
Go rob, rob, rob, Robinhood!

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.200
Ram, I'm looking for a job for you.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.240
Join if you like.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.600
Those who stash black cash are his "mummy-daddies"

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.320
Like an income tax raid He emptied their vaults in and out

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.360
He snatched the gold without knowing the chain

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.960
He's cold as a beer While committing a robbery

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.120
Stop!

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.400
Are you an Arab?

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.280
No.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.160
Then, why are you wearing Arab clothes?

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.960
-Is he a Punjabi? -No.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:22.840
I am here.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.480
Then why is he wearing Punjabi clothes?

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.480
Logic!

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.120
True devotee of Goddess Lakshmi Devi

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.400
He lifts fate like a toy

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.600
Bandits with a new style

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.000
The ship sank with a mischievous smile

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.920
No blood, no lineage—just the name

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.280
Walking ATM for the poor in pain

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.280
Rich people today

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.640
Getting his attention When bad times hit

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.800
He is like the sun, drinking the dry ocean

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.120
Then fill the clouds And shower the earth with drops of rain

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.200
A musician who plucks and then sings a lullaby

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.280
The magician who blindfolds everyone

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.680
Hey rob, rob, rob, Robinhood!

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.040
Go rob, rob, rob, Robinhood!

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.960
He is the fraudster who has been trending all over the news and social media lately.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.200
Where's the respect, man? He's our uncle.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.920
Let me go and see him.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.680
Catch the bloody bugger. move!

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.400
The dressing room is completely blurry.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.960
-Is he there? -That's still unclear, sir.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.560
To break through that door…

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.880
He will need the help of his ancestors!

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.280
There is no way to escape.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.800
He's trapped!

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.960
-Got it, Robinhood! -Ram!

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.680
He's here to catch Robinhood.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.280
-He's our special officer. -Special officer?

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.400
Darn!

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.320
Miss him again!

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.360
Who's he?

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.640
He was the first person to file a case about Robinhood, sir.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.600
Son of stockbroker Ramalingeshwar Rao.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.920
Sir, there was a robbery at our house.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.960
Everything my father earned was gone.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.040
My father is gone, sir.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.600
There's still no information about the robber, right?

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.960
I'm sorry, Ram. We're still trying.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.400
I will definitely catch the person who tore my family apart.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.280
This is just a job for you, sir. For me, it's a mission.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.600
One mission!

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.320
Sir, 20 to 30 people posing as technicians escaped.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.640
-Did you arrest anyone? -When asked, one of them said

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.320
that they were told to appear in these costumes for a film shoot, sir.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.200
He diverts our attention every time,

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.920
and run away.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.720
Wherever he ran away to…

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.400
I will catch him for sure.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.400
You troublemaker!

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.360
You think you're a hero, huh?

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.160
Do you really think you'll catch him before I do?

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.000
This is just a job for you. For me, it's a mission. I will catch him for sure.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.720
If I find you in this case again, or even run into you,

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.280
I will arrest you and declare you a Robinhood and close the case.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.840
Yes, sir!

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.320
I'm Robinhood. Starting today, my name is Robinhood.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.400
Go ahead. Catch me.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.360
-I'll shoot if I hear a word from you. - Sure. Go ahead. Shoot.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.480
Listen to me. Don't get yourself into trouble. Please go away.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.640
Please.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.800
Sharif.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.360
I would like to be informed of all his movements from here.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.800
When someone you help is in trouble,

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.480
standing alongside them in support is the true path of truth.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.360
Wow! What a great escape!

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.920
I wonder why you want me to create a family photo.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.720
But today, it really comes in handy, man.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.320
Hey, what's wrong?

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.120
When I was a helpless child on the streets,

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.680
An old man brought me here and left me in his care.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.680
Since then, he has been everything to me.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.600
The police arrested me today.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.280
They will contact him tomorrow.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.480
If that happens, the children in the orphanage will all be treated like thieves.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.600
I've used the only lifeline I have, man.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.040
I'm not taking any chances.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.680
I'm going to give Robinhood a break starting today,

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.680
and start working regularly starting tomorrow.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.600
Who will give you a job in a short time?

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.320
Groundbreaking achievement.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.600
Based on AV Pharmas medical cannabis from India

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.800
Oral cancer cure receives global acclaim.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.520
The Medical Council of India has issued a license to start a second unit in India.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.720
So, congratulations to the company AV Pharmaceutical and MD Abhinav Vasudev.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.240
-Good morning, sir. -The wind is a bit strong today, eh?

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.680
-Hey! The suit looks great. -Thank you. That means a lot coming from you.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.600
You don't fit in that suit. Go change!

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.720
You vile creature!

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.960
You set up your company here because they refuse permission in India.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.240
Today, they are really begging you to provide one in India.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.960
You are an achiever, friend!

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.960
Hey! You shouldn't be drinking coffee right now, buddy!

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.160
Champagne!

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.640
-No mood, man. -What's wrong?

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.320
-My daughter is injured. -But why?

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.880
So, if you all could join me

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.920
in congratulating our MD on his great efforts

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.720
Encik Abhinav Vasudev.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.840
And his daughter…

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:21.960
How much…

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.640
How much…

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.520
Miss… eh…

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.960
What is his name?

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.920
I don't know. I know her as AV's daughter.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.920
Daughter of Mr. Abhinav Vasudev.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:42.800
Unfortunately, he suffers from amnesia. He can't even remember his wife's name.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.160
He remembers your name, dad.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.600
Do you know the reason why children of famous personalities

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.680
Don't be famous by yourself, Dad?

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.560
It's not because they lack talent.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.240
This is because no one recognizes their talent.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.240
To grow… I must leave you.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.520
-Why stick to just one incident? -It's not about just one, Dad!

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.160
I have faced this since childhood.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:19.240
I studied hard and took the entrance exam to get into my favorite school.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.680
When I went to the principal's office excitedly for the exam results...

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:27.040
My marks are irrelevant. He gave me admission just because I am your daughter.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.480
You know how successful the first project I led in our company was.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.560
We received a letter of appreciation from our competitor company.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.360
You might think I've outdone you.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.200
My cabin is where I live,

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.600
but it's not my job.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.280
-No. Don't do this. -What?

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.920
-Are you starting to get emotional? -While looking for talent outside,

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.880
If we forget the talent under our own roof, doesn't it hurt, sir?

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.640
Hearing that,

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.840
My tears welled up.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.000
Having talent is one thing, assuming you have it is another.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.040
There is another angle to this story.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.280
Reading his answer after he studied hard,

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.480
The teacher had a seizure and collapsed.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.280
The principal refused admission after being hospitalized.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.960
To prevent her daughter from being disappointed, she bought the seat.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.320
Did you bribe him?

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.680
What?!

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.640
The company's value dropped 15 percent in a week!

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.040
Do you know how much it costs?

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.320
Dad! Do you know?

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.560
Our competitor's company sent me a letter of appreciation for my project.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.720
Why don't they, when they are the ones who benefit?

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.240
Are you proud of me, dad?

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.240
Uncle?

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.720
Why do you look so boring when you're happy?

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.280
-I have a headache, honey. -Headache, but why?

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.720
Do you know how headaches come, dear?

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.240
It comes straight to the head, doesn't it?

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.200
You are right!

00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.920
No, sir. Don't.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.280
Why are you crying again this time?

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.320
Didn't you say headaches come to the head?

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.000
Hearing that…

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.600
-my tears-- -are they in your eyes?

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.560
-Exactly, sir. Did it happen to you too? -Bloody idiot!

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.560
Stop it, friend!

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.560
I was already stressed that he was going to India.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.920
To India? What's this confusion?

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.920
Fish cannot live without water,

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.200
and I can't stay in a place where I'm not appreciated, Jyothi.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.600
Someone called you directly.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.840
If they call repeatedly, it means someone thinks I'm important.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.880
Am I talking to Pavitra's daughter?

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.280
-Who is this? -I'm your aunt, honey.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.320
I'm calling from Rudrakonda.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.840
Your grandfather is seriously ill.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.320
He has asked to see you.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.960
Our family is waiting for your arrival. You will come, right?

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.200
What?! Are you crazy?

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.600
After your mother and I moved to Australia,

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.600
they really treated us like we didn't exist.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.640
They never ask about you.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.600
Do you know how inhumane they are?

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.920
Even though we sent the news that Pavitra was gone, no one showed up.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.400
How can you think of going back to someone like that?

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.040
Father, a human being who makes mistakes,

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.600
and it is up to humans to fix the situation.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.160
Let him go, Buddy.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.960
So far… with those people…

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:21.000
friend. I am responsible for the entire journey.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.720
-What if there's a problem? -Behead me.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.160
I won't go, uncle.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.640
He's constantly calling and texting me every minute. What torture!

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.560
Going there is no different from living here.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.360
Listen, my dear. I swear on our friendship and yours and say that

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.360
None of us will bother you for these ten days.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.320
Give every update of yours to him.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.400
He will tell me, and I will convey it to him.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.480
-Hey! -You don't have to tell anyone.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.720
-Jyothi. -Reporting, sir.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.280
-Contact the flight crew. -I'll do that, sir.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.600
-Also, hire the best security in India. -Done, sir.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.560
-What if there's a mistake? -Lift my torso.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.040
Should I contact Rolex for a security agency in India?

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.200
What for?

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.720
So that you and Rolex can get a commission?

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.120
I don't trust people. I only trust Google.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.200
Oh my God, I don't know what a good moment is

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.280
making me name my company as India's Number One Security Agency,

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.600
every group of people who rely on Google

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.920
lost ended up in front of my door.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.360
Snack!

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.280
But the sad truth is,

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.880
I couldn't satisfy any of those customers.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.840
Forget about customers. You can't satisfy your employees either.

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.280
Hey, Ahobhilam agent…

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.480
I carried six lathi for security purposes the other day.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.000
I can only find four now.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.680
-Where are the other two? -Who knows? We must have lost them.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.000
When the security office itself does not have security for its belongings…

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.000
How will I satisfy you?

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:59.160
O God, may my company soar beyond the limits of the sky.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.520
-Excuse me, sir. -Yes.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.320
Who is Mr. Janardhan Sunnipenta?

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.680
-Did Murthy send you? -Wow!

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.000
Extraordinary talent! How did you know that, sir?

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.960
Only Murthy knows my full name.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.800
Why take the ugly name Janardhan Sunnipenta?

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.520
Oh my God, that's all for now.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.280
That's why I named myself Jon Snow.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.920
Agent Jon Snow.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.600
-What is your name? -I am Ram, sir.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.960
I can change it to Robinhood to suit the agency.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.880
You seem like a sharp person. What did you do before?

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.680
I used to wake up late.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.520
Because I am unemployed.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.280
If you offer me this job, I will wake up early.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.680
Customers will enjoy having someone with a sense of humor like you.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.360
You chose us, sir.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.040
right?

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.240
When you dig a borehole, you are first greeted with muddy water.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.280
Just like you.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.160
Mineral water followed later, just like him.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.520
Your time is on a different level, sir.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.640
One minute.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:06.960
Hello?

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.800
Am I talking to India's number one security agency from Google?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.320
-Yes. Agent Jon Snow speaking. -I'm calling from Australia.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.560
We need the best security services. Can you provide it?

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.200
-Hello! -Hey! Calling from Australia.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.800
-They need the best security services. -Why did they call us then?

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.120
Shut up, you idiot!

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.120
Please continue.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:33.120
Ms. Neera Vasudev, daughter of AV Pharmaceuticals MD is coming to India.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.920
I need your service from Hyderabad Airport to Rudrakonda

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.200
and return to the airport until you board your flight.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.880
-Are you okay with that? -Sure, sir.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.200
And I need category Z+ services.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.600
Hey, how many people fall into the Z+ category, huh?

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.840
Do you think someone who works for you knows anything about such things?

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:55.320
More.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.720
Any idea how much it would cost for six?

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.480
Tell him you're connecting him with the reservations team.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.200
Reservation team?

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.000
-But we don't have one. -And he doesn't realize it.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.360
Great idea!

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.120
We are transferring this call to the reservations team.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.360
Okay.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.280
Wah!

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.160
They also have a waiting tone. Did you notice how big the company is?

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.840
It's like riding an elevator.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.040
-Thank you for contacting us. -I hope it lasts longer.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.040
Okay, ya?

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.520
If you fill in the details on our website and transfer the amount,

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.520
We will assign Z+ category security for you. Thank you.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.680
How much does it cost?

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.280
Our expenses are around ₹ 40,000. Should I quote ₹ 60,000?

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.000
They can haggle for a discount. Quote ₹ 70,000 to be on the safe side.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.600
-He might leave if we quote that much. -One lakh.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.320
Aw, quick! That was a valuable deal! You've messed it up.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.200
It's a great deal!

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.480
Why would anyone give us ₹ One lakh?

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.880
I am not quoting in rupees.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.600
dollar.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.680
Dollar?!

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:09.320
Dude, I thought he was sharp. But he turned out to be a piece of shit.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.480
-But ₹ one lakh sounds cheap. -Did they say rupees?

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.880
It is India's number one security agency. It is in dollars.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.200
-Australian dollar?! -Did they tell you that?

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.240
India's number one security agency, US Dollars. Transfer the amount.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.920
He just transferred ₹ 75 lakh to our account!

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.840
Why is he calling me again?

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.800
Will he say he sent it by mistake and demand a refund?

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.800
He moved as soon as we asked. That means we asked for too little.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.200
Do one thing. Answer the phone and say we accept the advance.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.640
What advance?

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.360
He will ask you the same question.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.320
Tell him to hand over one lakh in advance and another one lakh once the work is completed.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.600
He has already paid us ₹ 75 lakhs.

00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.400
-It doesn't look good on us. -You tell him.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.480
We accept advance payment.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.600
What advance?

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.360
Pay us one lakh upfront and another one lakh after completion.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.560
-See you at six. -Yes.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.600
When I pray to God,

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.840
I hope he will show me mercy,

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.640
but I didn't think he would send you right away.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.600
I tell you openly, my son.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:27.000
This company has never handled a project worth more than ₹ 25,000 crore.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.240
I got tensed, receiving a sum of half a crore suddenly,

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.600
and my BP went down.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.640
Please don't worry. I'll take care of everything.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.600
You paid me ₹ 50 lakh. Can't I do that much?

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.120
₹ 50 lakh? what?!

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.280
Okay. ₹ 50 lakh is fixed.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.360
Sir, do we have a security team with us?

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.160
Are you asking if there is security?

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.800
boys!

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.400
Sir, they are asking for category Z+!

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.840
-This guy looks like he's 70 odd and 80 odd. -What?

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:18.120
-Can't we manage with them? -We need someone to manage them first.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.160
We need to change our settings and appearance.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.320
How?

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.560
All is clear.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.280
My son.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.600
Do you think everything is correct?

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.360
Everything is fine, but

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.560
We should avoid that banner, sir.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.160
Calm down, my child.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.720
We are handling an international project for the first time.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.000
How can we not do that little bit of publicity?

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.520
But the publicity shouldn't be so low, sir.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.200
It must be…

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.160
very classy…

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.520
-Sir... -Hmm?

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.320
Usually, girls use filters in photos to look good.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.280
Oh my gosh, this girl is so beautiful, actually!

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.520
You are excited to see the girl.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.120
I was worried that the man was coming from behind.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.680
What's wrong with that man?

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.560
He looks like a police dog in formal wear!

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.040
-What if he finds us? -Don't tense up.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.600
If he asks you any controversial questions,

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.280
say it is difficult.

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.280
I'll take care of the rest.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.800
That's it, right?

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.840
You are guaranteed to become a millionaire, sir.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.120
Welcome to Hyderabad, ma'am.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.200
This is a Robinhood agent.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.280
I am reporting from India's number one security agency.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.560
How was your flight, ma'am?

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.480
It's bad. Can you do something about it?

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.880
Let me get it for you. Yes.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:45.960
Welcome, Ms. Neera, who returned from a foreign country to her homeland.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.280
This is Jon Snow's agent.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.680
-How are you? -I'm doing well. How about you?

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.920
-I'm very good, ma'am. -I don't think so. It's below average.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.320
Thank You.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.640
Will a ₹100 bouquet make our boss side with you?

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:00.720
You will get a hit!

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.160
Sir, this girl is acting a bit strange.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.240
The less we talk, the better.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.920
Why bother, my son?

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.600
They paid us ₹ 1.5 crore.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.880
Forget about their repartee!

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.280
I don't care if they spit in my face.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.120
You forget that you are human.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.120
He added money.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.520
That's all that matters to us at this time.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.880
Let's go.

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.360
Madam, you are too bossy.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.600
You are just disturbing their beliefs!

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.160
-Jyothi. -Yes, ma'am.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.240
Like the silent letter "T" in the word "tsunami,"

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.960
You should be quiet in front of me.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.800
What the hell is this?

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.960
Hey! You promised us Z+ category security…

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.240
but only bring these six men!

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.480
Difficult.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.320
What do you mean by difficult? Hello--

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.240
Sir…Sir…Sir…

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.600
There are only six people around Mr. Modi.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.000
Does that mean his security team only consists of six people?

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:46.880
What then?

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.880
Look there. Do you see that man waving from afar?

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:51.880
-Who do you think he is? -WHO?

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.920
He's one of us, sir.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.960
-Is that so? -He's on duty facing that direction.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.400
Look there—he, who's going to leave with the bag.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.640
-Is he also one of us? -Are you still in doubt?

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.960
oh my gosh!

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.600
Why did he agree to board the flight?

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.040
He might have accidentally gone to the wrong place!

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.480
-Hey, stop him! -If he goes,

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:09.920
He will be back on the evening flight, sir.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:10.880
Now that's dedication!

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
You should be aware of that.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.920
you can see more than just us.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.320
Many people you don't know surround you.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.800
-You are being closely monitored. -Wow!

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:37.840
Madam…

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.400
Madam.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:49.000
If you need anything in Hyderabad, please let me know.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.280
-Is it? -Yes, ma'am.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.040
Do you see the white line in the middle of the road?

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.560
-Yes, ma'am. -How many are there?

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.320
Difficult.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.120
Ah! It's too hot.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:10.960
Madam, here is your itinerary.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:11.960
You will stay at the hotel today.

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.680
We will leave for Rudrakonda tomorrow morning.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.960
Tomorrow morning's plans are pretty good. But we're going out today.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.400
Jon Snow knows all of Hyderabad. Is that right?

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.280
Take me to a great place.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.640
Sure, ma'am.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.280
Give me the bag.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.600
I can handle it.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.160
Thank You.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.240
These rich people don't trust people like us.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.280
They were suspicious of what we might have taken from the bag.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.960
Why do we have to bother, my son?

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.600
We got one and a half crores in one week. Our future looks bright.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.360
You have become calculating.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.520
Tell me the truth. Was the man who sinned on the trolley one of your people?

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.840
You are wrong, sir. The man making tea over there is one of us.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.320
Oh wait! I can't think of that at all.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.360
No wonder you are India's number one security agency.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:04.920
What a team!

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.320
What is safe--

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.880
I heard it's difficult to get an Australian visa.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.880
-Right. -Then how did they give it to you?

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.880
What did he ask?

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.600
Difficult.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:19.880
Difficult.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.600
Starting tomorrow, the All India Handicraft Summit

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.280
will take place in Hyderabad for a week.

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.160
Chief Minister and Minister of Home Affairs

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.040
will be present on the last day.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.880
-You'd better be safe. -But sir…

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.280
I'm in the Robinhood case.

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.480
Yes, that's right!

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.600
He talks a lot about you, like AV on audio functions.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.480
Even if you call yourself Victor,

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.320
It seems like this case will not be won.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.720
What are you talking about? Wild dog? Huh?

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.840
Just a street dog.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.480
Dogs are best suited for guarding.

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.880
Go and stay safe.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.360
I will make sure who gets this case.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.960
Sorry sir, I will be on sick leave for a week starting tomorrow.

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.720
You look okay to me. What's wrong?

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.240
I was injured by a gunshot while cleaning a gun.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.960
As soon as I recover from it, I'll catch Robinhood, sir.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.320
Thank You.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.640
Why did you bring me here?

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.960
Madam… what are you asking us?

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.400
I ask you to take me to the best place.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.880
-Jyothi. -Yes, ma'am.

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.840
Do whatever it takes to get his name on the list of Padma Shri awardees next year.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.480
Blessed child!

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.840
Thank you very much, ma'am.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.040
WhatsApp me a copy of your Aadhar card.

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.320
You take anything from them because of money.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.560
Why do we have to bother, my son?

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.600
We got one and a half crores in one week. Our future looks bright.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.600
Just stop it!

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.920
-Mr. Jyothi? -Yes, sir.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.560
-Are you crying? -No recognition, Mr. Snow.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:45.960
While I found a gem like you,

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.200
Doesn't it hurt when he recommends the Padma Shri to you instead of me?

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.880
I'm not jealous of you.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.400
I just feel sad that I didn't get it.

00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.360
No, Jyothi. No.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.160
Mom. They took my chocolate.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.680
Tomorrow is my birthday. Please buy it for me.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.720
I don't have enough cash, Pinky.

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.200
Let's come back tomorrow and buy it.

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.840
-₹ 9,500, ma'am. -Actually…

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.000
I don't need this much.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.880
I will come back next week and buy this.

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:52.840
Congratulations, ma'am! You are our 10,000th customer.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.840
So, everything you buy today is at home!

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.840
-Can I have all of this? -Yes, ma'am.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.560
And my chocolate?

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.840
This chocolate is all yours.

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.720
Wah!

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.160
Thank you, uncle.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.920
Mom, I will give these chocolates to all my friends. I am very happy.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.920
Jon Snow.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.200
John! John!

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:05.000
Agent Jon Snow is here. Run for your life, friend!

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.920
-WHO? -Snow?

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.320
Knock me dead.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.800
Wah!

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:19.880
Jon Snow!

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.160
Peace.

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.240
I don't like it.

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.920
Sir, you are in a different league altogether!

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.400
This is unexpected.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.800
I want to raise expectations.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.920
So, I lined up the six guys.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.160
Do you mean you set those people up?

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.880
They paid us ₹ 1.5 crore!

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.280
Shouldn't they feel satisfied with us?

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.800
That's why I planned this.

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.680
They will start to see us in a different perspective.

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.000
He just became my fan.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.160
Sir, just one picture, please.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:47:59.920
Okay.

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:03.480
Frankly, you're pretty cunning, sir.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.480
A man must be cunning.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.880
I only hear about superheroes.

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:15.600
but first time seeing it in the supermarket. thank you!

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:16.800
-Jyothi. -Ms.

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.600
-We start at nine tomorrow. -Understood, ma'am.

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.280
Good night.

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.600
Your sincerity is truly humbling, bro.

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.840
-Do you stay here day and night? -It's my duty, sir. It's unavoidable.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.920
Hats off! You are the best.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.360
Now that I'm here, please give me some tea.

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:47.040
-Thank you. -Hey, give me some tea.

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.920
-Hey! -Just give it to him.

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.160
It was bad, as expected.

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.600
-Ugh! -But it's okay.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.520
You call this tea? No flavor, no!

00:48:58.960 --> 00:48:59.920
Why are you screaming?

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.600
Does he look like a professional tea seller?

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:02.960
-Number one India-- -Sir!

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.480
-No, sir. -Shh!

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.600
I won't tell you. Even if I lose my life, I won't tell you.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.520
What now? Don't you like tea? Wayward!

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.560
Hey! What are you talking about?

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.840
Hey! If I decide, your store won't exist tomorrow.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.880
Hey! What are you going to do, huh?

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.000
Once we left in the morning, he wouldn't make sure his shop was open.

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.840
You won't find any evidence. Misguided!

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:21.000
Get out!

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:21.920
-Go! -I'll go.

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:22.800
Sir!

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.600
-Okay, okay. No problem. -Sir!

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.120
You didn't pay for the tea, sir.

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.720
What are you, friend?

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:31.320
If you still act like a tea seller even after all this,

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.280
-What kind of acting? -I would marry you if you were a girl.

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.920
Promise!

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.320
-Only if you're a woman. -Something's wrong with him.

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:54.000
A person's body has many parts such as the head, neck, and heart.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.520
If you move, I don't even know which part I'll cut.

00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.920
Who are you all?

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:04.280
-We're here for the Australian girl. -What's up with her?

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.160
To understand it, you need to know about our village first.

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:09.240
We are from Rudrakonda.

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.600
It is the Nagulapalli forest area.

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.560
Greenery and fresh water are our wealth.

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.480
We used to cut down those trees for our livelihood.

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.600
When we destroy the forests that give life,

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.280
A great man entered our lives.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:28.840
He told us to plant saplings with the same hands that once cut down trees.

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.520
He taught us farming,

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.480
and the value of helping fellow human beings.

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.920
He is our guiding light, Mr. Vishwanath.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.840
Before we can celebrate the arrival of Ramarajya at Rudrakonda,

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.520
almost like Ravana coming from Lanka,

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.960
The footsteps of the devil can be heard in our village.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.520
This village is mine from now on.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.160
With God as my witness!

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.120
I can harvest a small piece of land.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.400
But how can I manage the whole village?

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.120
The villagers and Mr. Vishwanath will not allow marijuana cultivation here.

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:07.040
Go and convince them.

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:14.040
Has Shekaram returned?

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.720
-Can you call-- -What do you want?

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:18.800
-I'm here for Shekaram. Please call him. -I'm Shekaram.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:24.520
Are you Shekaram?

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.480
Where is Shekaram?

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:33.960
Don't you understand?

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:37.600
That's my wife. And that's my daughter.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.840
I am Shekaram!

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.520
Uncle Subbulu.

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.280
Uncle Subbulu

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:55.000
sell the house to me and go somewhere.

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.040
And you?

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.800
Why don't you trust me, Raju?

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.840
Give me a soda, Shankaranna.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.840
The entire village is under his control.

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.680
He has severed all ties between our village and the outside world.

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.680
No message, no words, and no sign of anyone.

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.640
He made us mute spectators.

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.800
He made our old men, who supported us, disabled.

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:39.600
He doesn't know how to convince.

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.600
He only knows how to eliminate.

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:51.160
We don't know why, but he now wants the chief's grandson.

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.240
We must save the girl, somehow.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.240
There's no time. His men will arrive soon. Where is he?

00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.560
Time!

00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:03.120
They took the girl away.

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.160
It's over. It's all over.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.560
They took the girl away. do something.

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.600
Mr. Snow.

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.120
What is this disorder?

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.000
We have allocated a room for you to rest.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:17.920
Why are you making a fuss here?

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.160
Please don't disturb me.

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:24.520
It's like watching a Spanish movie without subtitles!

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.160
What's going on here?

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:28.480
I am confused about the same thing, sir.

00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:29.920
Self-important people!

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.920
All Indians are the same.

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.840
Not you, I'm referring to the village men.

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.680
He has been demanding minute-by-minute updates from me since we started.

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:38.600
I gave him a second update after the fact.

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.360
Now, when I want an update, he doesn't answer my calls.

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.320
-A self-centered person! -What's the update?

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:45.200
Sir, did you land at the airport?

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:47.000
No, I'm at the bus stop. Came here by car.

00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.360
Which hotel are you staying at?

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:51.120
-Movotel, friend. Will you pay the bill? -Please don't be angry, sir.

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.160
That's ridiculous! Hang up the phone!

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:55.640
-Sir, what is your room number? -Why do you need that?

00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:56.640
If you tell us the number,

00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:00.280
Our Pandit will share the Feng Shui of the room and the occupant's horoscope.

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:02.880
kiss!

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.960
-Is it true? -It is true, sir.

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.320
It's 2013.

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.480
Tell me his horoscope, and I will get his attention.

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.960
Are you still there? She's my girl--

00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.040
Hello?

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:18.000
He asked for a lot of details, but didn't he ask for a photo?

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.280
That's right, Mr. Robin.

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.840
He didn't ask, and I didn't think to send it.

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.280
I won't send it anyway.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.920
I'm not talking to that selfish man!

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.200
Okay, Mr. Robin. Okay, Mr. Hood, I mean Mr. Snow.

00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.160
Why are you shivering, sir?

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.880
Do you want me to turn off the AC?

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:45.280
Does anyone sweat under the AC?

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.520
Since the time I heard about that Swami,

00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:50.960
My clothes are sweaty from fear.

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:54.960
If necessary, I will also work as security at a teenage girl's party,

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.840
but I will never step foot in that village!

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.000
He might ruin everything.

00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.600
Sir, don't you understand yet?

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:04.640
What should I think about?

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:08.040
Not realizing that you set up six men there, I set up ten men here.

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.200
Did you set them?

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:13.400
They paid us ₹ 1.5 crore. Shouldn't they be satisfied with that?

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.640
I became worried, thinking they were real.

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:20.600
Good night, then. We have to get up early. There's a lot to do.

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:24.720
Sir, you didn't give me a selfie.

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.600
You'll have it soon. But…

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.800
What's with the mountain image on your shirt?

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:31.880
Since we are going to Rudrakonda, I thought it would be symbolic.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.960
On the way, there was a village called Langalapalli.

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:38.680
Do you want to wear Langa to be symbolic?

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:39.680
Close?

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:43.040
Oh my god! You are fierce and equally funny, sir.

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.720
Whatever you say or do is great!

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.320
I expect two selfies from you.

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.240
I won't take no for an answer.

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.200
My son.

00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:05.320
Wow! How did he open the door!

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.560
Anyone would open a car door the same way.

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:14.360
She closed it beautifully.

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:22.640
If a girl like her enters my life, wherever she goes, my network follows.

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:33.480
Gucci Baby

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.960
Don't stab me with that look!

00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.800
little heart

00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.280
Don't break it with your hook!

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:44.720
"I love you, Rasna!" I said and chased after you.

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:48.640
90s kid, that's me now!

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:51.560
The first glance is knocked out like All Out!

00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:53.800
You are Boost energy, no doubt!

00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.920
Kiss me like a baby Amul

00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.840
Your taste? The best!

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.520
gold medal? You deserve it! Won't switch sides, you can trust it!

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.720
Your touch, smooth as silk

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.640
Lux Soap will agree!

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:11.280
Wherever you go, I follow Wherever you go, I follow

00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:14.240
Wherever you go, I'm following, bae!

00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:19.960
Wherever you go, I follow Wherever you go, I follow

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:22.920
Wherever you go, I'm following, bae!

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:54.960
Fresh and juicy babe You are my Frooti beauty, no debate!

00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:59.280
Born tough babe Macam tayar CEAT!

00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:03.840
"Feel the thunder," baby! I Thums Up you, constantly!

00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:07.920
A life full of sweetness Like Dairy Milk, when you are there!

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.720
our couple? so strong! Attached forever like a Fevicol bond!

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.920
age? The Santoor light remains on! Madness? Your city knows it all!

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.880
Your love? A masterpiece!

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.360
One Perk and you lighten up But my heaviness just piles up!

00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:25.520
"I love you" leaves you speechless. Time to turn on your brain, princess!

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:30.320
Wherever you go, I follow Wherever you go, I follow

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:33.280
Wherever you go, I'm following, bae!

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:38.920
Wherever you go, I follow Wherever you go, I follow

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.160
Wherever you go, I'm following, bae!

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:50.600
Wah!

00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:52.640
Beautiful!

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:05.880
Rudrakonda.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:03.960
Madam!

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.000
Why did you come here, ma'am?

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.640
Please leave immediately. You can't be here.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.840
Go quickly, madam!

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.040
Everyone who dares to warn the girl not to come here

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.360
has been hung before your eyes.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.320
Yet, you asked him to leave?

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.040
Don't you have any fears?

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.920
Please answer me, foreign girl.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.960
After Swami went through all the trouble of tracking down your number,

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.160
threatened the aunt and her children with a knife

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.960
to make them call you and drag you here…

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.280
Who is this guy to say you shouldn't come?

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.280
They also send people to warn you.

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.960
They made mistakes and were punished.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.920
It's good that I came.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.000
If not…

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.560
with this man

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.480
Other villagers will also lose their lives.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.840
That means all these guys are the real deal, right?

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.360
Oh my!

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.960
-No! No! No! -Stop!

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.240
Sir, why are you shaking with anger? Please calm down.

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.920
When heroes like you fight, soldiers like us end up dying.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.280
Please calm down. I beg you.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.720
Please don't.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.200
This man doesn't know.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.320
the difference between trembling with fear and shivering with rage.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.800
Who are you all?

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.240
Swami went to another village to make a deal.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.040
You will know everything when he returns.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.200
Until then,

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.560
Save yourself, these people, and your grandfather.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.640
grandfather.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.040
grandfather.

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.280
Hey, safety!

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.600
I heard one of you changed the room number and cheated on my man.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.520
How could he be so stupid?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.480
as long as you are here,

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:56.320
Our man will be a safety for you and your foreign girl.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.480
-Hey, Gana! -With God as my witness!

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.720
It's not you he needs, honey.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.840
He's after your father's license.

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.800
Indian Medical Council License

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:18.800
allowing your company to set up a pharmaceutical unit in India.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.640
With that license, one can legally grow marijuana here.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.800
The plan is

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.600
to conduct its business without interruption under the guise of medical transportation.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.280
That's why he asked you to come here.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.000
If that happens, it will destroy not only our village but several others.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.160
and many lives will be lost.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.680
To avoid that,

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.600
-You need to leave this place. -What are you saying, Grandpa?

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.880
What are the systems and the police doing about all this?

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.640
Their lack of action

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.480
Tells you how powerful he is, doesn't it, honey?

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.920
Before he set foot here,

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.400
you need to get out of this place.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.160
How can I leave you like this?

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:10.800
I sent your mother away that day so you wouldn't have to face this situation.

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:14.800
And today, I'm asking you to leave for the same reason.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.520
He's a monster, honey!

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.320
Please, son, get that girl out of here by any means necessary.

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:30.280
Boss! They ran away.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.120
Start the hunt.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.600
-Hey, I see! -Oh, no!

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.720
Sir, it would be better if you were in the car for safety reasons.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.240
Exactly right!

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:15.520
Finally!

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.680
You hit the brakes. Is it time for a break?

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.120
What the hell?

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.320
Why did he bring us here?

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.680
And he sounded the hon. damn!

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:49.400
Tango to Charlie. Turn the car around immediately.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.400
Okay, over.

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:53.560
Can you hear me? Reply if you do. End.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.320
Hey, this is too much. It's over.

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.600
Does this walkie-talkie work at all?

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:03.480
Cotton?

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.240
Cotton!

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:09.880
Mr. Snow. Mr. Snow! What the hell is this?

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.240
Cotton. Is it for cushions?

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.840
Trash, my son!

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.280
They have given us a contract of ₹ 1.5 crore.

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.800
Can you at least bring a real walkie?

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:25.960
So, is this a fake walkie-talkie?

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.280
They held a knife to your person to bring you here.

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.880
If you go now,

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.640
you will have no one left in the village to call your own.

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.480
So, those noisy people at the supermarket?

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:51.960
-Each one costs 25,000 rupees. -With GST.

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.600
What a fraud!

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.280
People like you don't deserve to live!

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.600
I became a fool because of you!

01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:14.840
You are not the fool here.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.120
When a walkie-talkie worth ₹100 is fake,

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.600
Look, I think this gun is real.

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.120
I'm the stupid one here.

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:24.600
World famous idiot!

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.200
All the chickens ran away.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.600
and reached the chicken farm.

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.280
With God as our witness,

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.200
we must give them a taste of death.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.640
You have thoughts of helping strangers.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.960
So how can you leave your family and village in this situation?

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.320
-How? -I don't want to go, Robin.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.920
-But I don't even know what to do-- -Why do you have to do anything, ma'am?

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.560
You pay us ₹ 1.5 crore.

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:08.920
Our job is to give you the satisfaction of money well spent.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.520
India is my country. All Indians are my brothers and sisters.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.920
How dare you enter my country and harass my family members?

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.280
You bloody outsider!

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.280
damn, damn!

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.280
Madam!

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:45.720
Madam! No!

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:51.600
The true strength of a king is not in his sword or crown.

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.880
It is in the army that stands before him!

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.200
boys!

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:05.800
This is your army.

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:08.600
And that is our strength.

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.000
Should we run away because we are afraid of him?

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:17.200
Or will we fight for your people?

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.720
The final decision is in your hands, madam.

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.040
They say if the purpose is noble,

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.160
you don't need a weapon.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.120
With someone like you by my side,

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.160
We can face anyone.

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.720
Even bigger than the ₹ 1.5 crore they offered,

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.560
I am experiencing real pleasure right now.

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:40.640
It's not ₹ 1.5 crore, sir. It's 6.5!

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.200
₹ 6.5 crore?

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.920
No matter where Robinhood hides in the world,

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:49.920
I will drag him out.

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:53.480
The sword hanging around his neck was named Victor.

01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:00.640
He doesn't follow a particular cause or agenda.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.800
All he cares about is money.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:06.120
He will fight anyone to get it.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.040
That, Varada, is my character.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.680
I could easily break your bones and take that girl away.

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.560
You must have understood it by now.

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:17.400
Quote the number that shows you can block me too.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:18.720
And we will close the deal.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:19.960
₹ One crore.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.000
With God as my witness!

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.280
Lima crore rupee.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.200
Madam, we first ran away and then fought.

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:32.560
We can use external resources.

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.880
Or I will send you safely and personally back to fight.

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:36.680
It's a scam. Don't fall for it. Okay?

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.920
-That's it. -Let's fight!

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:45.200
Track large donations to any orphanage instantly.

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.520
If he's Robinhood, then I'm Victor here.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.280
I'll show him what Victor's master plan looks like.

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:54.920
Robinhood agents and team reports, ladies. On duty 24/7.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:16.040
Swami, your goods are gold.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:18.600
But before you go for an international drug deal,

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.800
You should know about Alex.

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.800
He's a drug testing expert.

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.800
Once he tested and approved it,

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:27.480
David bhai will hand you over a one-year international contract.

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:30.800
That's why all the high-distance groups are anticipating this deal.

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:34.840
But Shukla couldn't stand it when new players entered into deals.

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:42.960
What are you saying?

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.880
That your stuff is stronger than mine?

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.560
Deena has been working for me all this time.

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.200
And now, you're using him to replace me on David Bhai's team.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.120
and enter the international drug market, huh?

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.960
What is this item?

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.200
This thing is not from this world!

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.080
Whose grass is this?

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.960
Swami's weed.

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.240
Hey, Siri. Call David.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.840
I just tried the new men's stuff. It's amazing!

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.240
-How much did he charge? -He--

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:40.520
Money is not important. We are just entering the market.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:43.840
Can you bring a lot of stuff here without getting caught by the police?

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.520
Take the lead if you can.

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:46.480
Swami,

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:50.520
He asked if you could cross all the checkpoints and deliver the goods.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.760
Tell him the police opened the gate to let the goods in.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:02.840
Welcome to the club!

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:05.880
From now on, David has a crew.

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:20.400
You achieved this position by replacing someone else.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.960
I'm replacing you.

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.600
My congratulations.

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:28.280
Continue.

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.160
Please don't mind me saying this, ma'am.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:13.120
-It's quite dangerous for you to stay here. -Let's go.

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:16.160
Finally!

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.080
The village is expecting me.

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:19.760
Let's free it and then leave.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.240
This village is expecting you?

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.440
-Which fool told you that? -Nature.

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.400
Many great souls fought for freedom.

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:30.160
But we achieved freedom only under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.640
He doesn't even know if we'll make it. But he fights anyway.

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.280
The rest is taken care of by nature.

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.040
What did he say?!

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:42.880
Many have fought for freedom—

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.120
Yes, their struggle is justified, but what is this man's issue?

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:46.360
Difficult.

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:48.880
He's right, Jyothi!

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.600
What seems dangerous today may not be threatening tomorrow.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.840
Today's truth can be tomorrow's lie.

01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:56.840
Who knows?

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:58.760
What kind of illogical statement is this?

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.800
How can today's truth be tomorrow's lie?

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:02.640
Common sense-- That's basic, ma'am.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:03.840
Good question.

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:05.600
-What's today? -Monday.

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:06.640
That's the truth.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:08.520
What if I come tomorrow and call it Monday?

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:11.440
- Tell me, Jyothi. - Lies.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.960
That's what I said. Is that right?

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:15.840
Great!

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:19.120
Madame Curie, Mother Teresa and Monalisa.

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.160
If we mix all their traits, you are the lady!

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.480
Oh my god! I was shocked.

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:26.800
I feel humbled to see you, ma'am.

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:28.760
It's not just you, Robin…

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.240
Even my Dad felt the same way.

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:34.560
I have had a high IQ since childhood.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.520
What is IQ, ma'am?

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.760
Who called our hands "hands"?

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.160
That's not me, sir.

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:46.200
Who first called our heads "heads"?

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.600
-Uhh... -I know it's not you.

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:52.400
Similarly, someone used the term IQ for IQ for the first time.

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:54.920
Why should we worry about such details?

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:57.880
Okay. What's our next step?

01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.760
How can we hold a torch to the Sun?

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:01.480
Can we think better than you?

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:05.080
Madam, your target is now our target.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:09.560
You handle Swami and Co.'s exit strategy, and we will execute it.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:14.280
We must know the enemy's strength and network before engaging in battle.

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:18.200
To find out, we must live in this village.

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.120
Yes, ma'am.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:22.200
If we go to Grandpa's house, he'll worry we're still here.

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:23.560
So…

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.400
until the situation is under control,

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:28.640
we need to stay somewhere around here.

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:42.040
Hey, hey, hey! I'm full of doubts.

01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:45.760
-Please tell me what happened. -What is your doubt, sir? Ask me.

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:49.600
Okay, he asks you. But how do you prepare this place?

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:52.560
I brought you all here because I know this place is under Varada's control.

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.640
You are very cunning, my son.

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.960
Didn't you tell me that human nature is cunning?

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:01.440
What are you spraying, sir? Body spray?

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.520
Does anyone spray body spray into their mouth?

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:05.840
-A burst of anxiety. -Oh.

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:09.600
First, you said ₹ 1.5 crore, and then, you said 6.5 crore.

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.480
You also talk about village freedom.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.960
What is your real plan?

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.360
₹ 6000 crores!

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:19.120
₹ 6000 crores?!

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.120
-Where are they? -What do you mean where are they?

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.880
They walk so sweetly in expensive shoes…

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.840
right before my eyes.

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:39.560
Millionaire.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:43.160
It is wrong to trap a girl for money.

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:45.640
It's wrong to like a girl because of her money,

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.760
But there's nothing wrong with the woman you like having money.

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:50.800
Anyway, I'm doing all this to increase your and my range.

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:52.160
How?

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:53.640
If that girl falls in love with me,

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.840
you will automatically get his company's security contract.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:00.480
India's number one agency will become the world's number one agency.

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.120
Wah!

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.880
That thought is so beautiful.

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:07.720
By the way, can you attract the girl's attention?

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:09.240
Robin!

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:11.760
I love this place, man!

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:14.920
Not the place, honey.

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.160
You are the kind of person I could have as my security for life.

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:22.600
You have caught my attention.

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:34.960
One look is enough, darling.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:36.960
I already feel very lucky.

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:40.880
Will you give me a burning touch? Again… Again…

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:44.800
I may look like a thug but a hug will melt me.

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:48.200
No delay, just give it to me now! Again… Again…

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:51.960
I've never felt this way before.

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:55.760
Even close to No anger, it's very strange!

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:59.760
They said I'm not in love with anyone But that all changed today

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:02.240
Why doesn't this man stay in one place?

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:06.120
Let go of that shyness, come closer

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.120
Yes, it's also called Again... Again...

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:13.880
Breaking limits, crossing the line every day.

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:17.440
Yes, it is a little

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.960
One look is enough, darling.

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:21.920
I already feel very lucky.

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:25.800
Will you give me a burning touch? Again… Again…

01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:29.760
I may look like a thug but a hug will melt me.

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:33.880
No delay, just give it to me now! Again… Again… Yes!

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:55.720
Oh my love my beautiful anger

01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:58.560
Your body is a package of beauty

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:03.720
Oh my love, one look at you and my heart is still frozen

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:06.480
Because of you, my sleep is ruined.

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:10.400
On the day you were a star on Earth

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:14.240
At night, I am your shadow, always by your side.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:18.160
To the palace of my dreams, you are the queen

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:21.800
And I became king Just without a crown

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:25.600
My pride never fades, my name stands tall.

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.560
But one look at you, and I fall

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:33.480
I've never felt this way before.

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:35.920
Won't you be quiet for a moment?

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:39.840
Let go of that shyness, come closer

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:43.800
Yes, it's also called Again... Again...

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:47.600
Breaking limits, crossing the line every day.

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:51.240
Yes, it is a little

01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.200
That's a scam!

01:25:58.360 --> 01:25:59.400
Praise the Lord!

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:03.640
To escape great danger, you must all make a promise.

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:04.760
What is it, boss?

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:15.360
If Swami knows that someone comes and beats us,

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.600
Our death is inevitable.

01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:21.560
We must all stick to the same words.

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.480
The foreign girl came.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.880
After warning him, we placed him on top of the hill.

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.480
Nothing else is happening here.

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:30.520
It should be as if nothing happened.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:31.840
With God as our witness!

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:46.920
How did he know your number?

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.600
-No clue, boss. -That's a scam!

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:50.840
Block him!

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:56.960
[simultaneously] Block him, boss.

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:03.240
Swami has come, boss.

01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:19.400
Did the deal work out, Swami?

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:24.640
Swami…

01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:26.640
The foreign girl is here.

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.520
I put him in the hilltop house after the warning.

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:31.520
I will think about what to do next from Premji.

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:42.720
We will step into the international market.

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:46.200
Yet there was no sign of joy or happiness. What is happening, Premji?

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:47.720
Swami,

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:52.280
You know your horoscope reflects the horoscope of Ravana, whom we worship.

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.600
Ravana, a man of great wisdom and power,

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:57.600
destroyed because he was chasing a woman.

01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:00.280
So you've made sure there's no place for a woman

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.400
in your life or in the lives of those around you.

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.160
This agreement is not suitable for us, Swami.

01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:08.440
Send the girl away.

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:11.280
Or else, your downfall--

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:20.360
I did this to stop those words in your throat, Premji.

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:24.640
The whole world must know

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:28.280
about the greatness of our products!

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.520
For my growth…

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:36.280
This is the war I wage!

01:28:58.480 --> 01:28:59.920
There is something in the field, Swami.

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:04.200
With God as my witness!

01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:16.120
sad.

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.720
Reading reviews about your company

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:22.600
makes me want to cry and spit for trusting someone like you.

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:23.560
Sir.

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:26.280
I cannot tolerate you mocking my company, sir.

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.720
It's not just me, you idiot. It echoes all over Google.

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:32.800
This guy's review says he hired you as security for a wedding party,

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.800
but a few outsiders still sneaked in and had dinner.

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.520
He gave you a half-star rating.

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:39.120
-Hey, Ahobhilam. -Sir.

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:41.840
-Who gave us that half-star rating? -It's Daniel, sir.

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.760
The contract was for 4,500 rupees, but he refused 500.

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:46.280
That's all, sir.

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.960
He refused 500 rupees.

01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:50.160
So I took my family to eat biryani.

01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:53.960
He considered them outsiders and gave us a half-star rating.

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:57.960
Please don't trust Google, sir.

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:01.440
I don't trust people. I only trust Google.

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:04.360
You clown!

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:09.840
I don't feel sad because I handed over a contract of ₹ 1.5 crore to you. No.

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:12.240
Remember how excited I was to ask for a selfie with you?

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.920
I can't share this with anyone, and I can't stay silent either.

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.160
I just have to go.

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.520
I must go.

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.080
Robin.

01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:26.040
robbery--

01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:28.960
Haven't you had breakfast?

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.520
-Yes. -What is this, then?

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:33.440
I want to give him the satisfaction that I have stopped eating.

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:35.560
and rushes to him when he calls.

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:38.040
-How about my satisfaction? -Then eat.

01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:42.840
You are more dangerous than that Ganja gang.

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:44.600
They look like children compared to you.

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:49.200
-Madam. -You're probably done eating, Robin.

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:52.240
Listening to you is more important to me than eating, ma'am.

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:56.440
Let's go out.

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.560
-Madam. Uniform... -You look good.

01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:03.600
Where are we headed, ma'am?

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:17.640
Rural Community Development Why are we here, ma'am?

01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:20.920
Do you know why I asked you not to wear uniform today?

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:25.240
You still think in a controlled manner, like one of my subordinates.

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:28.360
You should think on the same level as me.

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.520
to complete missions like us.

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:33.200
You should understand my idea while I'm still thinking about it.

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:34.800
-Actually-- -I understand, ma'am.

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:37.760
You write three points on the board.

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:41.080
The first thing is to know everything related to the enemy.

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:43.720
We came here to find out about the villagers and the officer.

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:44.560
Am I right?

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:46.400
That's my son!

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:50.040
Candles give light, but they need a fire like yours to light it, ma'am!

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:54.600
Is everyone healthy?

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.080
yes.

01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:58.200
Did they receive tribal subsidies on time?

01:31:58.600 --> 01:31:59.520
yes.

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.720
Are there any issues?

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:02.720
No.

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:05.280
Let me know if there are any problems.

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:07.240
The government appointed me to take care of you.

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.760
Rumor has it that marijuana is being secretly grown at the agency.

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:14.640
If it's true, just file a complaint.

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:17.400
-I will take action. -You must take action, Collector.

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:19.360
Why are you here?

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:22.040
Who are you? Who should we take action against?

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.760
I am Viswanath's grandson.

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:26.520
A person has been troubling the villagers for years.

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:27.360
-Why are you still here? -His name is--

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:28.560
No. Don't say anything.

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.360
Your grandfather is worried about you.

01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:31.960
-Please leave this place, ma'am. -Just go!

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:33.040
Go, ma'am!

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.600
Tell grandpa I'll be back in the evening.

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:35.760
-That's not it. -Go away!

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:37.240
-Please listen to me-- -Stop!

01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:40.960
If you want to say anything, here's my number.

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:42.760
Contact me anytime.

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:56.160
Do you think committing murder is part of the Olympic Games?

01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:59.480
You're going crazy, like you're competing for a gold medal.

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.520
Why did you kill that Goan merchant?

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:06.960
Now, we don't know who is supporting him or what they are planning.

01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:11.240
After learning that AV Pharma is making cannabis-based cancer drugs,

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:14.400
I transferred their files within the government considering the company important to us.

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:16.840
Knowing Abhinav Vasudev will not give in to money,

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:20.280
I gave you his family details and made sure his daughter came here.

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:22.960
I got you an entry for an international drug deal through Deena.

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:25.600
As expected, you get David's contract.

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:28.520
Just as entering international markets is important to you,

01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:31.720
Coming back to power next time is just as important to me.

01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:36.200
Until this happens, just focus on the goods and licenses.

01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:39.520
-Did you talk to the girl? -She's on her way here.

01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:51.280
Why delay after this long?

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:53.800
Stepping out.

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:12.640
-What? -The second point you wrote on the board.

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:14.400
-Find your enemy. -Oh, right!

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:15.240
yes.

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:16.280
-Brother... -Yes?

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:28.560
Oh my God!

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:30.480
What a big plant!

01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:32.040
Mr. Collector.

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:34.840
You said you would take action against people who grow marijuana.

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:36.160
Please take action sir.

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:38.040
Madam.

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:41.280
Your actions there were deliberate.

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:42.720
You're right, Robin!

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:44.080
I understand, ma'am.

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:48.720
I don't understand.

01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:49.920
Isn't this the next step?

01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:52.080
Oh!

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:54.240
That's my son!

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:06.080
Blank check!

01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:08.640
Write as many crores as you want.

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:14.600
Leave this village, and if possible, this country too.

01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:28.160
Premji told me not to harm women.

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:31.160
That's the only reason the axe misses you.

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:38.040
Money is not important to Swami.

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:40.200
The market is important.

01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:45.520
We will start harvesting as soon as we get the message from the international market.

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:47.800
Before that,

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:52.240
We must have a local license.

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:57.120
If you expose this issue or blow it out of proportion,

01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:00.200
The entire city will turn into a cemetery.

01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:02.560
Go.

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:10.760
He asked for your license. Is that true?

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:14.200
I will tell him on your behalf that you will not allow this deal to happen.

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:29.640
With God as my witness!

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:31.480
He's just pointing, sir!

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:32.960
It just accumulates!

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:35.520
In fact, he stopped before you could raise your hand.

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:37.280
With God as my witness!

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:47.560
For the first time, I saw someone who thought money wasn't important.

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:51.160
For me, money is everything.

01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:54.080
Varada promised me ₹ 5 crores to keep the girl in the village.

01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.720
He is not answering my calls and messages now.

01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.640
He blocked me on WhatsApp this morning.

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:02.160
It seems the punch I gave that fool wasn't enough.

01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:04.160
Hey! What do you mean, hit me?

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.760
Do you have the courage to stand up to Swami's men?

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:08.960
Hey! It seems you don't know.

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:12.840
Swami has already seen the complete film on a 70 mm screen.

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.760
The collector didn't even know that we arrived by car.

01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:17.600
Then, how did he know?

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:20.080
He is not a magician.

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:22.960
But… he's a good technician.

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:25.240
[In Tamil] Don't you understand?

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.520
Do you think that's a scarecrow?

01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:31.240
It has a camera.

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:39.840
There is also a camera in this tree.

01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:45.880
There are a total of eight cameras here.

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:49.200
The list includes those in seats occupied by ministers.

01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:50.800
Do you know, Mr. Minister?

01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.760
He placed cameras all over the village.

01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.160
and turn the entire village into the home of the big boss

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:00.640
by watching the visuals on his phone.

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:02.160
With God as my witness!

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:15.520
I don't know why I'm the only one who sees these things.

01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:19.240
I worry about what else I will notice and reveal in the coming days.

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:23.400
Coronavirus gives you 14 days of quarantine.

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:26.160
If it were me, it would be for life!

01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:28.920
Please don't keep me here too long.

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:32.840
You have discovered something that no one else has been able to discover all this time.

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:38.720
You must be respected.

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:40.600
Come!

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.520
I don't give free hugs.

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:48.160
I will hug you if you pay me.

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.600
Hey, Swami. Don't.

01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:52.840
-Collector, I'm taking the vehicle. -Don't do anything rash. Listen!

01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:56.520
If we kill him now, the news will reach Australia.

01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:59.400
Please don't hurt anyone until we close this deal.

01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:00.800
Okay? Please.

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:10.480
We got official confirmation.

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:11.920
It's time to have fun!

01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:13.760
Set a time to harvest.

01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:15.160
And I will plan the party.

01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:17.440
Just a little!

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:20.120
-Enough. -Your assistant,

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:21.840
Are you sure that the girl will come back?

01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:24.280
We came here only after we were informed he would be here.

01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:25.960
Jon Snow, what is his status?

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:27.600
On the way, sir.

01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:29.440
What? Did you hear it on the walkie?

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:32.520
Let's try it.

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:34.760
The texture is very good!

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.520
Has anyone appreciated your rasam before?

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:47.160
-No. Nobody said that. -Then why did you succeed?

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:49.760
There is no salt or flavor in it! My stomach is upset.

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:52.040
Sister, where do you dispose of waste water?

01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:57.560
Did you put it here?

01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:00.800
In India, they don't put salt in wastewater.

01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:11.440
We are relieved to know you are coming back, dear.

01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:14.720
We can all be happy once you hand him the license, honey.

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:18.720
Are you well, ma'am?

01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:20.360
-Jyothi, it's okay. -What?

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:23.840
Madam almost killed Swamy. It was a close call.

01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:26.520
Is that true, ma'am?

01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:27.720
Madam?

01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:30.880
I was furious to hear his messy story.

01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:33.240
I found an axe nearby and threw it.

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.560
-Axe? -Not a body blow.

01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:36.960
A real axe!

01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:38.520
Are you serious, ma'am?

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:41.400
I need to freshen up.

01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:47.840
Just like dancing to an emotional song,

01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:51.440
is there a connection between his body language and the hype you created?

01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:52.800
What exactly are your plans?

01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:55.520
Which is the oldest animal in the world?

01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:58.440
The latest animal is Ranbir Kapoor.

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.960
-The oldest is a dinosaur? -No!

01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:03.840
-Zebra. -Zebra?! How?

01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:08.240
It's still in black and white!

01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.400
It is known to be a drop.

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:15.960
The unknown is the ocean!

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.280
Damn, man!

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:21.200
Do you know what you're doing, honey?

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:25.280
I want to go back, grandpa.

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:27.520
I can't leave you like this.

01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:30.520
You are stubborn, just like my daughter.

01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:34.200
He went with your father even though we asked him to stay here.

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:37.840
We think he'll at least be happy wherever he is.

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:41.200
But he left this world.

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:46.520
Now, you stay behind when we ask you to leave.

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:49.600
What if something bad happens to you?

01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:52.280
Everyone has a death date just like their birth date.

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:54.920
But if you are afraid of death,

01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:57.360
there will be no value for the days we live, sir.

01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:00.640
Even if you can't physically stand,

01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:04.880
You are still trying to stand up for this village and your family.

01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:07.160
He shares your blood.

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:10.440
How could he leave you knowing your life was in danger?

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:13.960
If we are afraid as children,

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:16.360
we will ask any of our family members to stay with us.

01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:20.400
That's because being with loved ones gives us courage.

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:24.200
This fear is contagious, sir.

01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:27.280
It has spread so deeply in your family.

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:30.280
With just one phone call you make, the girl comes for you.

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:33.760
The girl wanted to stand by her family in a crisis.

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:36.040
Your fear is so strong that you cannot embrace it with love.

01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:49.160
Neera…

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:37.200
Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy

01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:39.960
Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy Ecstasy, ecstasy it is

01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:43.200
Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy

01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:46.200
Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy Ecstasy, ecstasy it is

01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:04.400
Many, many days ago, in Mamidipalli A farmer was arrested at night

01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:10.720
When tying the knot, she said she didn't get any subsidies.

01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:16.800
When he sulked and was asked about it, he showed the crops.

01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:21.160
It's not rice, it's not chili. It's not sugarcane.

01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:24.520
The crops he planted were weeds.

01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:26.400
That's the surprise!

01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:29.480
That's the surprise!

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:32.760
That's the surprise!

01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:35.760
That's the surprise!

01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:53.440
In a posh pub in Jubilee Hills

01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:56.520
A very stylish man Making a striking entry

01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:59.520
He called me Chinni Then called me Munni

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:02.840
Keeping a little distance Showing a lot of respect

01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:08.960
Ask me to come with you And I go to his villa

01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:13.640
Said I wasn't his soulmate, but his father had other plans.

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:16.640
Turning Munni into Pinninya!

01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:18.520
That's the surprise!

01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:21.760
That's the surprise!

01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:24.880
That's the surprise!

01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:27.960
That's the surprise!

01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:01.280
My chubby cheeked boyfriend Met me in Bangalore one day

01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:07.040
So handsome that if he waves his hand Even though it's second-hand it feels brand new

01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:13.280
Saw a photo of a girl in his wallet Stopped there and asked her

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:17.920
Not his cousin, not his girlfriend Who is she?

01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:21.840
Well, that's it before surgery!

01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:27.560
I hope it lasts a little longer. Sigh!

01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:29.520
Don't be disappointed.

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.280
Neera, shall we continue?

01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:33.960
Of course, Robin!

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:36.160
Start the music!

01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:51.640
That's the surprise!

01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:55.280
If a winning lottery ticket expires, that's a surprise!

01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:58.880
If hidden cash becomes illegal! Well, that's a surprise!

01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:02.480
If you give an apple to an Apple phone, it's a surprise!

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.360
If the pot is the best part of the biryani pot!

01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:06.200
Boom! That was a crazy surprise!

01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:25.160
Many great souls fought for freedom.

01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:27.560
But we achieved freedom only under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.

01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:31.280
-Are you copying my idea? -I just used it!

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:37.080
He doesn't even know if we'll make it. But he fights anyway.

01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:39.480
The rest is taken care of by nature.

01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.560
We must follow the ways of our ancestors.

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:43.640
What?

01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:45.840
Does this girl have four fathers?

01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:49.720
Even though she's a foreign girl, why does she speak openly?

01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:51.480
Hey! Tell me the truth.

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:53.160
You failed in your 10th standard English exam, right?

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.080
I also failed in 7th standard. why?

01:47:56.280 --> 01:47:59.200
"Ancestors" doesn't mean he has four troubled fathers and mothers.

01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:00.560
He talks about his ancestors.

01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:02.840
Are "ancestors" under caste?

01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:06.640
Don't get me wrong. I failed in Telugu too!

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:08.800
-I wish you well, sir. -Why?

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:12.160
We only have one road ahead.

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:15.720
Please don't support Swami. No one should go to work.

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:18.040
We are going through our own share of suffering.

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:19.520
Please don't get involved in this.

01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:25.160
You said the village depends on you.

01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:26.840
But even the old man doesn't trust you.

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:29.440
Listen to me. Let's get out of here quickly, ma'am.

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:30.640
-Please. -Mr. Jyothi.

01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:32.920
Smart people always have more than one plan up their sleeve.

01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:34.280
They will have a plan B.

01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:35.560
I understand, ma'am.

01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:38.960
If this method is not possible, we must attack from the other side.

01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:39.960
Am I right?

01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:41.960
If not from this side, which side will you go through?

01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:44.040
Jyothi, you always--

01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:46.920
-Robin. -Madam?

01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:48.360
There's a camera there.

01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.240
Where?!

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:51.840
-Don't turn back! -Okay.

01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:55.920
If the marijuana gang is ready,

01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:59.080
What about smart people like us?

01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:01.080
I understand, ma'am!

01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:02.840
He has a camera.

01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:05.920
You want to hack his phone via camera access. Is that right?

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:08.480
That's my son!

01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:09.920
make it!

01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:13.880
Is he really smart?

01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:17.120
Do you know who first coined the term "smart person"?

01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:19.840
I understand. He is a wise man himself!

01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:21.760
That's my son!

01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:24.160
-Jyothi! -You-- Come, ma'am.

01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:28.560
You speak without thinking!

01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:30.840
What about the phone? What do you mean we hacked?

01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:32.560
We've hacked it!

01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:33.960
when?!

01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:53.720
Yes! We have intercepted Swami's phone. What next?

01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:57.120
Send the same message to all contacts.

01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:59.960
Okay. Sending!

01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:01.480
Your phone has been hacked!

01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:03.480
We clicked on the message from your number.

01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:05.360
And all our phones were hacked.

01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:08.880
Who is trying to stop me?

01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:10.840
Who is it?

01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:20.920
This Sagar guy is killing me with his calls!

01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:24.760
I can't turn off my phone or block it.

01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:27.120
I should hire a contract killer to kill him.

01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:42.640
kiss!

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:45.480
Hello?

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:51.120
Are you angry?

01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:53.640
-Hang up the phone now, ma'am. -One second.

01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:57.120
It's not Swami who stopped you. The man. Verified.

01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:01.040
Jyothi, how can anyone stop me?

01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:03.920
-I have decided to give freedom to-- -Stop it, ma'am.

01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:07.040
You can't even reply to messages. Can you free the entire village?

01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:07.960
Jyothi!

01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:10.080
The intentions are quite twisted, ma'am.

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:12.400
He stares at you while you talk on the phone.

01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:13.560
Is he?

01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:16.960
With your permission, I will reveal his intentions today.

01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:19.840
Robin!

01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:21.840
-Yes, ma'am. -I'm bored.

01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:23.200
I have designed the game.

01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:27.040
Whoever is pointed to the bottle must ask the spinner a question.

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:28.240
But… Hello!

01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:30.200
Why sportswear?

01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:32.440
You said we were going to play a game so I dressed up.

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:33.840
We played truth or dare.

01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:38.120
Do we use gloves or helmets when playing?

01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:41.240
Hey, you waste! Keep this there!

01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:50.520
-Truth or dare? -Dare.

01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:52.080
He's cheating, ma'am.

01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:55.040
I dare you to tell me the truth.

01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:59.280
-Truth. -You didn't receive any calls, did you?

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:01.880
-I didn't receive any calls. -That's it!

01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:04.400
Look, ma'am. The intention has been since--

01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:08.440
Do you have any girlfriends?

01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:11.160
Why worry about his girlfriend? Irrelevant question. Stick to the mission.

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:13.960
We need more information to know about his intentions.

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:14.840
Go for it.

01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:17.400
Do you have any girlfriends?

01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:22.520
-No, ma'am. -Why not?

01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:24.560
I promised in my childhood that "India is my country"

01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:27.520
and all Indians are my brothers and sisters."

01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:32.840
I am waiting for a foreign girl to enter my life.

01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:36.040
See you, ma'am. He's been targeting you since--

01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:40.760
Why does he feel shy?

01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:44.840
He will feel shy at first and then fall in love with her eventually.

01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:51.840
Truth or dare?

01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:52.840
Truth.

01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:57.720
Ms. Neera, you didn't receive any calls just now, right?

01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:04.840
Should I just tell the truth, Jyothi?

01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:06.720
Yes, you should tell the truth, ma'am!

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:11.840
I didn't receive any calls.

01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:14.760
Madam!

01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:19.120
If you don't receive any calls, why are you cat walking in front of him?

01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:20.440
What is your intention?

01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:22.040
Tell me.

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:24.280
This is not your turn, Jyothi.

01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:26.120
I disqualify this question.

01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:27.120
Mr. Snow…

01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:35.160
Mr. Jyothi, what places do you often visit?

01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:36.640
This question is illogical for the situation.

01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:39.240
This world is so illogical, Mr. Jyothi!

01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:41.160
How?

01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:43.200
-England starts with an "E," -Yes.

01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:44.600
but India starts with "I!"

01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:48.760
Wow! Awesome Robin!

01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:50.440
Thank You!

01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:52.840
This question is better than the situation.

01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:56.920
Mr. Jyothi, what places do you often visit?

01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:00.120
Depression! I will experience depression every day because of you.

01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:04.160
-Karma! Just for fun-- -Is there a "depression" place?

01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:09.200
I mean… Some of my clients have been there.

01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:11.120
I salute you, messenger!

01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:19.160
He prints and sends all the information from your phone one by one.

01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:20.400
Swami.

01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:22.760
Message from David bhai.

01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:25.080
He asked when we would send the goods to him.

01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:27.160
Tell him we'll send it on the 20th.

01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:29.720
What if the message wasn't sent by David bhai...

01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:32.560
but by hackers?

01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:35.960
Isn't it risky to reveal the date of transportation of our goods?

01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:38.200
Don't do that.

01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:40.760
Don't reply to the message.

01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:44.080
If the message was really sent by David bhai…

01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:47.160
We will lose our lives for not responding.

01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:49.800
-Ugh! -What the…

01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:52.600
Whoever that guy is, he's just playing with us.

01:54:55.840 --> 01:55:01.760
Did the guy who hacked our phone know we knew they were hacked?

01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:06.520
He might not know it.

01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:09.480
Maybe he doesn't know.

01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:18.640
-Hey, Deena. -Swami.

01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:22.880
Transfer ₹ 1 crore to the minister's account for the party.

01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:24.480
Okay.

01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:31.920
-Tell me. -There's good news for you.

01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:34.480
All orphanages receive their monthly money transfers.

01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:35.400
But how?

01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:38.160
The party received funds. I used them as our funds.

01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:41.720
We've been defeated, my friend!

01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:47.760
Check where the amount goes.

01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:56.600
The amount was transferred to an account named Ram Dootha Hanuman.

01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:00.160
Give me the account details immediately.

01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:06.520
It's definitely a fake account.

01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:09.840
Find out where the amount went from that account.

01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:13.920
The amount was transferred to the orphanage and the elderly home, sir.

01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:18.840
Don't keep a single orphan home.

01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:53.760
Hey!

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:56.160
Since you sent that amount to the orphanage,

01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:58.920
I understand how important they are to you.

01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:00.840
I don't know who you are.

01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:05.560
All life is against you. It's time to unmask!

01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:13.800
Hey, send him my photo.

01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:15.400
But friends…

01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:17.520
He should have targeted me, not the orphanage.

01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:19.600
Send him my photo.

01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:37.040
With God as my witness!

01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:07.720
Madam, madam.

01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:15.520
Swami's men!

01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:25.800
Swami's men are here.

01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:32.160
-Father-in-law-- -Which grandfather?

01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:34.720
grandfather?

01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:37.720
-Grandpa? -Grandpa!

01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:42.160
Neera's father-in-law is missing.

01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:44.240
Dad is missing!

01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:46.480
He is not at the top level.

01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:52.400
Robin. Robin!

01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:57.280
Robin is missing too?

01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:00.720
It means grandpa is safe.

01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:25.720
After beating him to death, what did you watch instead of killing him?

01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:32.560
We didn't beat him.

01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:44.760
We can't beat you under normal circumstances.

01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:47.840
That's why we reassure you.

01:59:57.840 --> 02:00:00.240
All this time, we thought that foreign girl was your weakness.

02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:02.240
I only understood when Swami told me.

02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:19.160
Balcony…

02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:22.720
Salvation is here not for the girl…

02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:25.600
but for the old man.

02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:42.600
Hey Varada,

02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:45.400
they say a man is high on weed

02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:48.760
stuck in the same mood as him.

02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:54.160
Right now, I'm only in one mood.

02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:58.480
If you lay a finger on that old man, I will kill you.

02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:04.360
If you lay a finger on that old man, I will kill you!

02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:07.120
I will kill you.

02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:30.160
I bleed when touched…

02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:32.400
but I couldn't feel the pain.

02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:33.440
Bos!

02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:36.120
Usually, a person is sedated to help him or her cope with pain.

02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:37.720
But we anesthetized him first.

02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:39.520
Now he won't feel any pain, boss.

02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:43.080
What am I now?

02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:44.960
Like Spiderman and Superman,

02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:46.480
Am I spoiled?

02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:05.800
Robin!

02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:09.760
Escape from here!

02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:13.560
They are monsters.

02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:24.480
Robin!

02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:27.040
My granddaughter was alone there.

02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:30.360
They will endanger him.

02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:41.280
Let him have his plan.

02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:45.040
I have my backup.

02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:05.760
I'm the only one here.

02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:08.160
But there…

02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:11.640
There are four others like me.

02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:27.400
Your granddaughter…

02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:29.440
safe.

02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:38.600
What…?

02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:45.720
I see Robin in all four of you.

02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:49.400
Who are you all?

02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:23.520
The Nizamuddin Express to Delhi is two hours late.

02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:25.440
We are upset about the difficulties experienced by passengers--

02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:26.400
Two hours?

02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:27.920
-A little help. -Hey, heretic.

02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:30.880
Chandrayya, have you had any changes in you?

02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:38.720
Sir, this is your wallet.

02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:44.040
Thank You.

02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:53.160
God bless you, son.

02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:55.240
Hello, Robinhood.

02:05:57.360 --> 02:05:58.520
Yes, you. Come here.

02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:01.800
My name is not Robinhood.

02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:04.760
-It's Ram. -Your family has chosen a good name.

02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:07.520
-Where are they? -I don't have anyone.

02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:09.840
India is my country.

02:06:10.760 --> 02:06:12.760
Never say you have no one.

02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:15.480
This country is your family.

02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:18.440
All the people are like family members.

02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:21.400
From now on,

02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:23.400
Call me grandpa.

02:06:23.560 --> 02:06:25.200
-Okay? -Okay.

02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:28.760
-Yes? -We are on our way to Delhi on an assignment.

02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:31.280
We don't know anyone here.

02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:33.400
If it's not too troublesome,

02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:36.080
Please provide shelter for the boy for two days.

02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:40.160
-I'll pick him up as soon as I get back. -The boy will be here until you get back.

02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:42.040
-Kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi...-Ram! Ram!

02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:43.280
Grandpa!

02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:44.360
-Can we go? -Hey, Ram!

02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:46.760
-Come back quickly. -We will win only with you.

02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:49.520
Didn't you say these are all my family members, Grandpa?

02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:53.160
They need me now. I'll be with you when you need me.

02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:54.160
Take it.

02:06:55.160 --> 02:06:56.640
But, sir. This is…

02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:02.080
You are a constant support for all these children.

02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:04.840
We will be the support you need.

02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:08.640
From now on, the responsibility of this man and the ashram rests with me.

02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:15.280
You will receive help from us every month without fail.

02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:16.440
you…

02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:17.760
What is your name?

02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:20.960
If I take credit, the help becomes mine alone.

02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:24.080
If I remain anonymous, it becomes humanity.

02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:26.040
This is the next generation.

02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:29.080
They need to see people as inherently good.

02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:40.600
Ram!

02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:56.120
Ram!

02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:22.640
My son!

02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:27.520
I don't know who you are. But please help me.

02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:28.960
A monster is dragging

02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:31.960
our granddaughter from Australia to our village.

02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:35.280
The hands that helped us need our help now.

02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:37.840
We risked our lives to cross the village border.

02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:41.960
I was injured while running away from the criminals who were chasing us.

02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:44.160
I beg you.

02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:46.920
Please save our girl! Please save her.

02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:52.440
What? Planning to retire from your Robinhood job?

02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:55.240
No way! What's the problem?

02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:58.800
We misunderstood them. They didn't stop helping us.

02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:02.040
Hello?

02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:03.960
It actually stopped because they were having problems.

02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:07.440
When someone helps us in trouble,

02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:09.800
we must support them in supporting.

02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:11.160
We will support you.

02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:13.040
A private jet has been booked from Australia to India.

02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:14.280
They landed on the sixth.

02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:16.520
I'll run Google, and you run it.

02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:18.080
Sir, this is a confirmation call.

02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:19.880
You land at 9:30 am on the sixth.

02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:21.040
9:32 am.

02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:23.040
India's Number One Security Agency, right, sir?

02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:26.240
Basically, VIPs like you approach the agency.

02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:29.160
India's Number One Security Agency.

02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:30.160
Yes!

02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:42.040
Ram!

02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:47.520
Do you remember my little help?

02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:50.880
You gave me a family when I had no one.

02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:55.360
You take care of us all year round, even when we just ask for food.

02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:57.360
How could I forget, Grandpa?

02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:02.600
Whoever helps us in our difficulties is equal to Allah.

02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:07.120
If such a person is in trouble, someone must stand by their side until their last breath.

02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:11.040
You've been with me all this time.

02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:14.440
Why didn't you tell me it was you?

02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:17.560
Grandpa, as you once said,

02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:20.440
“If I take credit, the aid is mine alone.

02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:22.800
If I remain anonymous, it becomes humanity."

02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:27.040
You've lost enough. You shouldn't have anything more to lose.

02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:29.040
That's why I brought your grandson back here.

02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:36.560
Hey, safety.

02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:38.640
Just like you have a backup,

02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:40.720
even though I have a backup.

02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:43.800
I was playing a movie in the middle of the village.

02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:45.280
Go watch it.

02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:51.720
In ancient times, there was a village called Rudrakonda.

02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:53.480
This is a Cannabis farm.

02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:58.920
The villagers have become experts in growing narcotic plants.

02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:02.360
They are the ones who plant the crops,

02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:04.840
and they are the ones who transport the harvest illegally.

02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:08.720
Do you know who is the mastermind behind them?

02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:17.280
Hey, safety!

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:20.720
The old man you feel you saved

02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:25.240
and this village depends on it

02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:30.200
Everything will be destroyed with this one video.

02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:33.640
To stop that from happening…

02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:36.960
You must hand over the license to me within 30 minutes.

02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:40.520
My officer is waiting.

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:42.600
Run!

02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:44.400
Robin, let's go.

02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:45.760
This agreement is important to him.

02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:47.600
He definitely won't reveal this video.

02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:49.880
-In the meantime, I will somehow-- -Robin, please!

02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:52.360
Please don't fight me, just this once.

02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:53.640
Let's go.

02:11:57.200 --> 02:11:58.120
Hello?

02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:21.360
You have come into my kingdom and done all this…

02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:29.920
I must congratulate you today.

02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:34.960
Come.

02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:40.640
If you don't come, I'll have to say hello to the villagers.

02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:48.160
-Come. -No, Ram.

02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:33.440
Hey! God is my witness, I don't know anything!

02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:34.720
You are a fraud!

02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:36.920
Just kill him. If you let him go,

02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:38.840
not only this one, he won't let any deal happen.

02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:40.160
He will eat us.

02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:43.840
Hey! You're saying I can't make a deal with him?

02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:45.800
I'll make him close the deal for me.

02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:48.360
When the deal is completed,

02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:51.560
I will welcome you both together.

02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:52.600
Deena.

02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:55.520
Safety,

02:13:56.400 --> 02:14:01.400
if you want that old man, this village, and that video to be safe,

02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:06.520
You must deliver the goods in person and safely.

02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:33.560
I warn you that

02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:37.160
Any failure in the deal with David will cost you your life.

02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:38.920
The goods did not arrive on time.

02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:41.280
Watch as each of your heads gets hacked.

02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:42.600
What do you mean the item hasn't arrived yet?

02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:44.720
The truck started last night by itself.

02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:46.600
Only the lorry arrived.

02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:47.880
But the goods are not there yet.

02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:49.760
David bhai has landed in India.

02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:52.560
May your soul rest in peace.

02:14:57.440 --> 02:14:59.160
-Hey, Man! -Swami.

02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:01.520
Where's Muthu?

02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:03.120
I am Muthu, Swami.

02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:07.800
Azhaga!

02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:10.840
-Azhaga! -Swami.

02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:15.160
He entrusted all the tasks to me and left for Sri Lanka overnight, Swami.

02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:21.040
Swami?

02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:24.600
Swami!

02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:34.600
Hey, Stranded!

02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:36.240
With God as my witness!

02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:52.960
Hey, Swami.

02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:56.720
If you make a substitute, it is art. If I do the same thing, will it hurt you?

02:15:56.920 --> 02:15:58.520
Shouldn't you be fair?

02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:00.080
Come on. Let's sit down and talk.

02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:05.480
You must have realized by now that I can do whatever I want with your stuff.

02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:08.480
Quote the number that can block me.

02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:12.400
We will close the deal.

02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:15.520
How much do you want?

02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:17.760
I asked Varada the same question, the other day.

02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:19.240
I don't get any money,

02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:22.880
But I'm happy I broke your trust, you're 30 years old.

02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:24.840
Isn't that when you started avoiding him?

02:16:25.480 --> 02:16:29.360
Even if I keep him away, he can't stay away from me.

02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:31.880
Is that right? Where?

02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:35.480
Why isn't he by your side?

02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:38.800
Your master plan is to step into the international market,

02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:42.160
hand over this whole village and your people to David,

02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:45.440
and settled in Dubai alone.

02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:47.600
When I told you, he and his gang threw you out.

02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:50.520
and leave you here like an orphan.

02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:52.120
Master plan?

02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:55.600
I never had such a plan.

02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:56.760
Of course, you have no such plan.

02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:59.040
But I told them you did it. And they believed it.

02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:00.760
That wretched fool!

02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:03.520
They have been with me for 30 years.

02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:05.640
How can they trust your words?

02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:09.520
-I'll show them hell-- -Hey!

02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:11.160
I'm just kidding.

02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:14.280
They don't believe me. But you believe my words.

02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:17.200
And you should be their leader.

02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:21.560
If you trust the words of outsiders like me, without thinking twice,

02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:23.760
it is not surprising

02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:26.720
The people who work for you trust me, Swami!

02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:44.520
Don't you get high?

02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:48.160
God is my witness. This is yours.

02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:52.160
I hacked your phone and stole your contacts.

02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:55.520
With the blink of an eye, I trigger your ego

02:17:55.800 --> 02:17:58.280
and make you close the deal with me.

02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:01.600
I reject everyone who stands next to you,

02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:03.240
have emptied your account,

02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:07.240
and leave you like an orphan in the same village where you were orphaned!

02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:10.120
Hey, Swami…

02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:12.720
You learned about me after I entered your life.

02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:15.840
But I learned all about you before entering your life.

02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:18.840
I am more dangerous than you.

02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:22.080
Hey! Who are you?

02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:28.800
You brutally killed my father, who was loyal to you.

02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:31.640
are you…

02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:33.360
Perumal's son?

02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:35.600
Or Dorai's son?

02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:37.800
ours!

02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:44.480
Hey, I'm kidding again!

02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:48.480
How can you believe everything I say?

02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:51.640
After replacing all these people,

02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:54.440
How fair is it to let you go?

02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:57.640
I also replace you.

02:18:57.720 --> 02:18:59.040
Hey! Stop it!

02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:03.840
If your strength lies in weaving magic with words,

02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:07.040
I take life by action.

02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:10.400
I don't need that stuff.

02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:12.880
I just want to take your life!

02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:19.280
For you to kill me, you have to hit me first.

02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:21.160
To defeat me, you have to touch me first.

02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:24.480
What is the use of all your power, Swami,

02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:28.360
When can't you touch me?

02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:41.400
If you dare, come catch him, friend! Touch him, and you'll go straight into a coma

02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:44.360
He is an uncountable wild warrior. Are you listening, Rama?

02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:47.560
He climbs over your head like a storm A little spark that shows you the stars

02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:50.520
Cross him, and you're on your way. Thieves around here? Better keep quiet.

02:19:51.720 --> 02:19:54.520
Against a swarm of ferocious bees Like fate carving a stone

02:19:54.600 --> 02:19:57.520
Why did you hit me, man? Look at this. I got a bruise!

02:19:57.640 --> 02:20:00.520
Burning red, she's a firestorm! Yet, she asks you to kiss her!

02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:03.640
Now you have scorched your crispy mustache!

02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:19.280
Trapped like a fly In Spider-Man's nest

02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:25.400
Like an ant that stings If you stick your finger into its nest!

02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:31.400
If you dare, come catch him, friend! Touch him, and you'll go straight into a coma

02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:34.440
He is an uncountable wild warrior. Are you listening, Rama?

02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:37.720
He climbs over your head like a storm A little spark that shows you the stars

02:20:37.800 --> 02:20:40.800
Cross him, and you're on your way. Thieves around here? Better keep quiet.

02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:43.920
Left, right, up, down Like a washing machine gone wild!

02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:46.960
Front, back, back to back Spinning cold, breaking hard!

02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:49.920
Inch by inch Crushing like a sugarcane press!

02:20:49.960 --> 02:20:53.160
No gaps, no maps Rolling smooth as ice!

02:20:57.200 --> 02:20:59.200
Like playing kabaddi With raw electricity!

02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:11.080
Robinhood's own brand chaos!

02:21:15.160 --> 02:21:16.960
He's sparking a storm in your mind Waiting to explode!

02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:25.160
Goodbye!

02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:35.160
You have covered my death through the hand of the God I worship.

02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:38.880
See what Premji says about your Swami.

02:21:41.800 --> 02:21:44.120
Varada! Don't believe Swami.

02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:47.400
He set up the camera without our knowledge.

02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:52.840
He plans to leave this country after selling us to David bhai.

02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:57.040
You are the only one who can save me and our people, friend.

02:21:58.920 --> 02:22:00.280
I will do whatever you say.

02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:20.720
[In Tamil] What is bothering you, Swami?

02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:50.840
Hey, police! I'll pay whatever you want.

02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:52.640
Finish him off first.

02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:57.040
Are you trying to buy me with the money you stole from the people?

02:22:58.720 --> 02:22:59.840
Robinhood!

02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:01.520
Robinhood?

02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:03.120
Who is Robinhood?

02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:07.560
I don't know what or how you're going to do it.

02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:10.560
I want my money back, and you should get Robinhood.

02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:13.960
Find out which accounts receive money from the minister's account.

02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:19.880
Rama dootha Hanuman.

02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:21.520
RH.

02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:23.880
Rama dootha...

02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:25.400
Robin.

02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:27.200
Robinhood.

02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:31.880
How could you reach Robinhood before me?

02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:34.280
Family emotions are more important than all emotions.

02:23:34.480 --> 02:23:36.920
It may be your job, sir. But for me, it's a mission!

02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:42.280
I'm not Robinhood, sir.

02:23:42.840 --> 02:23:44.840
-Ram! -Sir?

02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:49.200
What would you say if I caught you, saying you were Robinhood?

02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:52.400
I'm not Robinhood, sir.

02:23:55.520 --> 02:23:57.160
No one can fool Victor.

02:23:57.800 --> 02:23:58.920
Who is Victor now?

02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:03.960
I have been waiting for this day for several years.

02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:05.640
-Robinhood is-- -Sir.

02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:08.600
Hey, he's not Robinhood.

02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:10.240
Maybe it's not him.

02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:11.720
You are right, sir.

02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:13.840
If we expose him as Robinhood,

02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:15.640
He will become a hero in society.

02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:17.800
I don't want bad guys to be heroes.

02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:20.840
To the outside world, he's not Robinhood.

02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:24.640
-Are you going to talk to him? -No need!

02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:33.640
If you find a thief like him, people will call us his partner.

02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:39.520
-Anyway, you've done a great job. -Thank you, sir.

02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:46.960
That's why we call him a wild dog, sir.

02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:53.200
Varada already told me about you…

02:24:54.440 --> 02:24:56.520
that you are a big fraud!

02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:01.040
You have changed my name and place.

02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:05.400
Who is Robinhood?

02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:27.960
Can you bring a lot of stuff here?

02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:29.840
without being arrested by the police?

02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:31.880
David's brother?

02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:56.040
You look fit.

02:25:57.880 --> 02:25:59.760
But not suitable for David!

02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:13.080
-You are very addictive. -Thank you.

02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:15.920
But David hated addiction.

02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:21.160
The appointment time is 9 o'clock.

02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:23.120
It is 9:05.

02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:24.360
Want to have it?

02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:25.560
No!

02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:28.640
Red lollipop.

02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:30.240
The enemy is dead.

02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:31.800
It's a David quote!

02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:37.560
The devil becomes nobody.

02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:40.520
-Because of a man. -Who is that, bhai?

02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:51.600
ROBINHOOD!

02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:57.600
He is not only in your life,

02:26:58.040 --> 02:27:00.160
but he is in my life too!

02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:03.360
And wherever he is,

02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:06.960
I will take his life!

02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:11.160
Who is Robinhood, sir?

02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:16.160
God created all humans equal.

02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:19.080
But money created by humans

02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:21.960
has brought about differences between us.

02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:26.360
A heroic figure who fought to eliminate inequality

02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:29.120
and uphold human justice

02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:31.080
-that's Robinhood.
